## Inspirations for my blog and site format
In trying to develop my own blog, and personalize it according to my taste, I did my best to draw upon examples that piqued my interest. Here are just a few that I drew inspiration from:
1. [Feeling-Responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive)
2. [Artist Theme](http://ninapetrop.github.io/Artist-Theme/)
3. [Lixizhi](https://github.com/lixizhi/lixizhi.github.io)
4. [Documentation Theme Jekyll](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/)
and of course, the master himself...
5. [srikanth-narayanan](https://github.com/srikanth-narayanan/srikanth-narayanan.github.io)
