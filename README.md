My personal site, full of whoknowswhat!
[https://nialtilson.github.io/](https://nialtilson.github.io/)

A little bit of background - I started writing a blog way back in 2013 as a part of my exchange program in Germany. Essentially, I really only did it so my mom and sisters could see all the stuff I was getting into over there. But, through time, my growing passion for photography, the interest in sharing the world with whoever will listen, and it being a great way for me to remember all the adventures I get into, I've tried to keep up with it following the end of the program.

Now, this has simply developed into an idea to incorporate my blog and whatever else I see as a potential fit into a personalized website for me. So why this undertaking?
  * I'm cheap, and didn't want to pay for a custom site.
  * I'm a tinkerer, and like taking on (and especially completing) projects
  * I'm a learner, I like to add to my growing quiver of skills

All three of those things combined, plus completion of the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree, has got me here. Let's build!


## Inspirations for my blog and site format
In trying to develop my own blog, and personalize it according to my taste, I did my best to draw upon examples that piqued my interest. Here are just a few that I drew inspiration from:
1. [Feeling-Responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive)
2. [Artist Theme](http://ninapetrop.github.io/Artist-Theme/)
3. [Lixizhi](https://github.com/lixizhi/lixizhi.github.io)
4. [Documentation Theme Jekyll](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/)

and of course, the master himself...

5. [srikanth-narayanan](https://github.com/srikanth-narayanan/srikanth-narayanan.github.io)
