    <h1>A GREAT DAY</h1>
    <br>

    <p>Read the title. I had a great day.</p>

    <p>It started out with a nice breakfast with my guest grandpa. Some nice conversation, decent food, and a great, relaxing way to start the morning. Before I left, I had some great music flowing through the speakers. Fader - The Temper Trap was just getting me pumped for whatever was coming; giving me a good tune to face the day.</p>

    <p>I got to the library and started doing work on applications. I wrote down phone numbers I needed to call for applications I've already submitted and applications that I wanted to make sure were not yet filled. Got that stuff done, then did my calling. No big successes, just more hold on for a few weeks, but at least I got some practice on the phone in German.</p>

    <p>After that, I had a random desire to be educated and informed. I started reading things on the internet and learned a lot. About a new biofuel coming from plants that can be grown in the desert and watered with salt water that could revolutionize biofuels. About the State of the Union address, and how it seems like the Republican party is still not doing anything to help the US, but moreso hinder our progress. How there are different facets to our attention, and how they affect our daily life, AND how walking around in a forest or any type of nature can refresh your mind (no wonder I like nature so much!!!). I need to keep this streak up.</p>

    <p>Then I came home, made a little bit of food, and had a nice conversation with my boy Zack H. Talked about some current events for both of us. It was nice to get some things out you know, nothing like talking with good friends and expressing some opinions, as well as hilarious thoughts, and tons of other stuff.</p>

    <p>Then, more awesome music. I'm just hitting the music jackpot today. It's amazing how that will affect my day. I just feel in the groove. Ready for everything. Just awesome overall. I wish I could have the perfect jam set everyday. But, since I don't, I am absolutely rocking out to today. Rocking out in every way, and I hope you are too.</p>
