    <h1>HODGE PODGE BEFORE IT ALL COMES BACK TOGETHER</h1>

    <h2>Article about Millennials and Travel</h2>

    <a class="body_ctr" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/how-millennials-are-changing-international-travel/373007/">The Atlantic - How Millenials are Changing International Travel</a>

    <p>This article really puts this year and a lot of things going on in my life and with my generation into perspective. The standard goal of going to school, finding a job, and grinding away for 40 years until retirement is slowly eroding away as people see that there is so much more flexibility in life, and coming to the realization that life is meant to be lived, not worked.</p>

    <h2>Herr Mielke</h2>

    <p>Never have I ever seen so much attention and love given to a robotic lawn mower. Not just any lawn mower, my landlady's (Frau Mielke) Herr Mielke, as he is endearingly referred to.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ejZUeoah.jpg" alt="Herr Mielke's Domain"></img>

    <p>He works constantly at keeping the grass in order, and he is a constant topic of conversation. So far, every time we've grilled or sat around in the back yard, Herr Mielke has had a good 5-10 minutes time in our conversations. It's pretty interesting/ridiculous/funny.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/1u1Qo0Oh.jpg" alt="Herr Mielke's Home"></img>

    <p>And now his home just got a little beautification.</p>

    <h2>Garden Life</h2>

    <p>I am unbelievable lucky for everything that I've been able to do and experience this year, and the last 5 months its been centered around the awesome place I've been living.</p>

    <p>I have an awesome landlady, and awesome roommates, and I am unbelievably thankful for every aspect of it. As an example, I went out drinking last Saturday night, came back late, and didn't wake up til 11:30 (new sleeping-in record!!! :-D ). As I woke up, I saw a text from Elke asking if I wanted to join her for breakfast.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lBpbCegh.jpg" alt="gemütliches Frühstücken"></img>

    <p>Well, standing up initiated the hangover, but Elke had everything ready for me. So I just rolled out of bed and was treated to delicious Austrian sausage and bacon on her roof terrace. Let's just say I'm all sorts of lucky.</p>

    <h2>Green Porno</h2>

    <p>Lutz was invited to some play for his birthday by Elke, but since he had to work, I was called up from the bench to fill in this role. So I went with Elke and a few of her work friends to this thing called Green Porno, by Isabella Rossellini. Let's just say it was interesting.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/i6uX47ph.jpg" alt="Green Porno"></img>

    <p>I learned a lot about how animals have sex, which was really interesting. For instance, did you know that the female duck has multiple vaginal cavities, so she can have many mates, and essentially decide which one will actually become the father? Crazy.</p>

    <p>Well it was definitely a unique, and cultural experience, and quite unique having a 62-year-old lady so vibrant and energetic on the topic of animal sex. I would have never gone to that on my own volition, but am pretty happy that I did, if nothing else for the story, but also for the atmosphere and the fun facts.</p>

    <h2>House Visitor</h2>

    <p>Last week, for Lutz's birthday, his dad came into town for a couple days. And he brought with him his little buddy, Paul.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/KUewwN1h.jpg" alt="Little Paul"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yFqGZLLh.jpg" alt="Little Paul 2"></img>

    <p>I was totally surprised when I walked in and this little guy started jumping around at my feet! It was great to play with a little puppy for a bit. But really, it just made me miss Dude a little bit more. I can't wait to get back home and have my little buddy back!!!</p>

    <h2>LEGO Movie</h2>

    <p>The LEGO Movie is by far my favoritest movie ever. It had literally everything I want in a movie. It was hilarious, had childish humor, but contained so much truth to everything I know and remember about playing with LEGOs. All of it just fit so well together, and its so true and awesome. EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!!!! Definitely excited to watch that with my kids however far down the road.</p>

    <h2>Die Weltmeisterschaft (The World Cup)</h2>

    <p>The World Cup is in full swing, and the atmosphere is awesome!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/40XqRGDh.jpg" alt="World Cup Viewing"></img>

    <p>Spain Nederland next to a bus stop. All of a sudden guy comes out wie bitte at 1-5. He was the bus driver.</p>

    <h2>Beautiful Hamburg</h2>

    <p>As I've said earlier, Hamburg is a beautiful city. And, to my surprise, I'll be living here for a little bit longer!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lgeaIoQh.jpg" alt="Another Canal in Hamburg"></img>

    <p>Well, I didn't end up getting invited to the interview with RWE, so I'll be accepting the position here in Hamburg with 8.2 Consulting AG to come onto the team for full-time. I need to meet with the CEO and talk about all of the details, especially about what I'll be doing (dear god I hope it's something interesting!). But it's looking like I'll be staying a Hamburger for a little bit longer. WOOT WOOT!</p>

    <h2>Coming Up - Trip</h2>

    <p>I'M GOING TO NORWAY AND I AM SO FRIGGIN PUMPED!!!!!! A lot of my work time has just turned into trip planning and research. And holy tits I am so ready to go. I bought a tent and plan on camping the whole time, and just getting lost in the beauty of the cities and nature that I'll be surrounded by. OH BABY. Oslo - Flåm - Bergen - Ålesund - Geiranger - Lillehammer - Oslo. 16 days and it's going to be AMAZING!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <h2>Coming Up - Post-Trip</h2>

    <p>After my trip, I've got two days in Hamburg (watching the 3rd and 1st place games of the World Cup), enough time to pack up my backpack for a little romp back in the USA. Once I get back from Norway, things are going to go by really friggin fast. It's gonna be a whirlwind, and I'm a little nervous/sad/anxious/excited for it. A melting pot of emotions.</p>
