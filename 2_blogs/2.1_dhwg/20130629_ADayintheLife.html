    <h1> A DAY IN THE LIFE? </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      I've been back in Washington for a little under a month. The majority of
      my time I've been working for some friends and family doing mainly
      roofing and yardwork. Though some may hate manual labor, I actually enjoy
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the last five years, thanks to school and internships, I have not
      been able to do much of this kind of work. What I like about it is I get
      to be outside, using my hands, working my butt off, and building up a
      sweat. There's nothing like being done after a hard days work and looking
      back on what you've finished. I sure as hell didn't get that feeling from
      sitting at a desk all day!
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, today I was handing down shingles to be nailed on, and I was taking
      notice of my surroundings. One thing was the neighbor next door was
      trying to have an in-depth conversation amidst the repetition of the nail
      gun and slapping down shingles. Another was a bunch of the neighbors just
      shooting the breeze and watching us work. Noticing these, and the general
      thing of working in the yard, and it got me thinking... How would this
      situation look in Germany?  Would this situation even happen in Germany?
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis</h2>

    <p>
      I'm gonna think about this for a sec. From what I've heard, Germans are a
      much more reserved people. Small talk between strangers is fairly unheard
      of, and it takes much more to develop friendships and relationships.
    </p>

     <p>
       From these, in a similar situation in Germany, the neighbor would not be
       out trying to have a conversation, let alone small talk. Also, the other
       neighbors down on the street might not be shooting the breeze with the
       other neighbors, but would probably be interacting with people they are
       more familiar with (who could in all possibilities be other neighbors, I
       don't know).
     </p>

     <p>
       But would this kinda project be done in the first place?  Are Germans a
       handy people?  Do they like to do their own yardwork and home
       improvements?  This, I have a feeling will vary greatly between people
       and families, just as it does here in the U.S. For example, even in my
       family, I enjoy this kind of work, but neither of my sisters do. So
       imagine there's quite a bit of variability between people like that.
     </p>

     <p>
       Long story short, I would be interested to get a taste of home
       improvement, and how it is done in Germany. Could be pretty interesting
       to compare my experiences to new ones there!!!
     </p>

     <h2>I'm Not a Ginger, Trust Me</h2>

     <p>
       Anecdote time. We started the roof on Friday. All tearing out the old
       roof to start. I could feel my skin getting a little warm towards the
       end of the day. Got home, showered, and holy cow did I have a wicked tan
       on my arms and neck (wearing a sleeveless shirt all day). As an
       experiment in the shower, I turned the water on to pretty cold.
       Not mountain spring cold, but pretty close. I let the water hit me right
       on the shoulder and trickle down my arm. When it got to my hand, the
       water was already luke-warm. Quite the sunburn I'd say.
