    <h1>A STRESSOR OF UNIMAGINED PROPORTIONS</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      I normally hate packing. A weekend trip can be something that could take
      me a few hours to get ready. A couple weeks? I start going through all of
      my possessions and ask myself, will I need this? What about this? Though
      I have gotten a lot better over the last few years, I'm not that good.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what task is ahead of me right now? I have to pack for a whole year,
      and only take one check-in (65L internal frame backpack) and two
      carry-ons (little suitcase and a school backpack). HO. LEE. CRAP. This is
      getting stressful.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't want to have to ship anything later, international parcel service
      is a little pricey. I can't go to another check-in and/or an extra bag,
      that's an extra $200. And I'm trying at all costs to get everything into
      these three bags without causing zippers to break or fabric to rip under
      extreme duress.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've got under 48 hours to get everything squared away and ready for this
      amazing adventure. Lets see if I can do this...
