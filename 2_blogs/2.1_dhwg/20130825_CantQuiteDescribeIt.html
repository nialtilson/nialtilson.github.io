    <h1> CAN'T QUITE DESCRIBE IT </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      For some reason, the last couple of days I feel like I've been in a bit
      of a haze. A language haze. In some ways I feel like I'm still kind of in
      my American bubble in Deutschland. Or that I'm not doing enough to get
      exposure and practice speaking German. Or that I'm just in a funk and I'm
      not sure what's going on. Or that there is literally nothing wrong and
      I'm making a problem out of nothing. I've been known to do that too...
    </p>

    <p>
      I can recognize that I have had some huge improvements in being able to
      understand what people are saying. Though I may not know all of the
      words, I have gotten better at getting context and piecing together the
      message. That is kind of refreshing. Even though I have no strong ability
      to get my view into words, I can understand a good portion of what is said to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whatever this funk is, it's kinda funky in a funky sorta way. That make
      sense? Enough melancholy, time for UPDATES!
    </p>

    <h2>Frisbee for Days (and some Weekends too)</h2>

    <p>
      We had practice again on Thursday, and it was even better than Tuesday!
      We had more people show up, and we were able to do a lot more. On top of
      that, we scrimmaged the women's team at the end. So I FINALLY got back
      into a game after an über long hiatus. It felt really good.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Tuesday, I was all sorts of sore from such an abrupt jump back into
      doing athletic things. Thankfully, after trying to stretch as often as
      possible, I didn't do anything damaging and my body felt fine during and
      after practice on Thursday!  I'm still a little worried about my
      hamstrings (I strained both of them a year or two ago) because I don't
      want to get injured any time soon. But they're looking like they're
      doing ok so far!
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyways, practice went really well. I got there pretty early to do some
      homework, and I got some help from one of the guys on the team. I was
      trying to explain my placement in Magdeburg (details in a sec on that)
      and the emotions involved with that and it was a fun experience. Me
      trying to piece together my thoughts with the little German I know, and
      seeing him totally confused as to what I'm actually trying to say, or
      tell me how a German would say the same thing in a completely different
      way. That was nice to have, and I hope by practicing and playing with
      these guys, I'll get a lot more of these experiences!
    </p>

    <p>
      Practice started, running and throwing and stuff happened, and I was able
      to piece together (through context and words and stuff) what was being
      said by the captains. They were explaining their three offensive sets and
      I think I did pretty good for verbal comprehension. We'll say B-. But we
      had a scrimmage against the girls team. I had a really good layout score.
      I was all sorts of pumped about that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Afterwards some really cool stuff went down. First, I was invited to play
      in a hat tournament next weekend. It's up near Lübeck, and I get to drive
      up with them and get a whole car drive of me and my beginner German to
      practice with them. That'll be awesome!  Next, I was told about a hat
      tournament during Oktoberfest. Yes, frisbee and beer, in the beer capital
      of Deutschland. The only thing is, that's the weekend after I move to
      Magdeburg, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to work it or not. I'm
      definitely going to try though.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, I was approached by one of the captains and another player (he
      seemed like the O captain) and they asked if I had a certain weekend
      open. I told them I had no idea, then they told me to keep it open. It's
      not 100% (I'll find out on Tuesday), but the captain that was there said
      he was going to talk to the other captains and possible invite me to play
      with their team at the German Club National Championships. How freakin
      cool would that be?!?!?  I'm really hoping they ask me to play, cause
      that would be a ridiculous experience!
    </p>

    <h2>Magdeburg, Final Placement</h2>

    <p>
      Thursday, I had a meeting with Steffi from the GiZ about details
      regarding my final placement!  I was pretty pumped to get some details
      coming in!  Well, here's what I found out.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of September, I will be moving to
      <a class="body" href="http://goo.gl/maps/GlFYI">Magdeburg</a>. It is the
      capitol of the Bundesland of Sachsen-Anhalt. I will be studying at the
      Otto-von-Guericke Universität Magdeburg, and will have to find an
      internship in or near Magdeburg for the internship phase. While I am
      there, I will be living with an older gentleman on the northwest side of
      town. From what Steffi told me, he likes literature and the theatre, and
      his grandkids come to visit on holidays.
    </p>

    <p>
      So far, I've heard mixed reviews of Magdeburg. A lot of Germans in the
      west have said it's nothing special, but other people have said its a
      gorgeous city in the former East Germany. The big downside is that that
      area is flat, so it'll kinda be like I'm back in Columbus,
      landscape-wise. Like an idiot, I started to get really worried and mopey
      about my placement. But thankfully a friend snapped me out of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I go into it already bummed, there's no hope for enjoyment. So I am
      optimistic and ready to see what the new city will have in store for me!
      I still need to do some research and see what kind of companies are there
      and who I might be able to get an in with for the internship phase.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      It's a rainy day here in Köln. I've been in my PJs all day and probably
      will keep that going until I go to bed. The host family is off in Italy
      for two weeks so things are a little quiet. A couple friends are coming
      over later for a fantasy football draft, but I still need to get my
      homework done. Kinda feels like a lazy winter weekend in Columbus, to be
      honest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless, I'm still chugging along, practicing and learning everything
      that I can.
