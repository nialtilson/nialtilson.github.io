    <h1>STRESS WHERE IT SHOULDN'T BE</h1>

      I had the talk with Dietrich regarding my place in the home. It went really well. I have been essentially welcomed in to the family, but given space to do as I please. Even when it comes to meals, he said that I can come and go as I want and he is being super gracious. Also with getting involved, and finding my own activities to do, I have his blessing to come and go as I please. One big sigh of relief and appreciation there.

      But honestly, some of it kinda worries me. I've NEVER been good at accepting gifts and being doted on. If you know me, you know that. So now I move in to this gentleman's home and he is pretty much welcoming me in no strings attached. I'm kinda worried about that. I feel like I need to be doing something to earn my keep. I asked him if I should be doing my dishes, or if there's chores that I should be doing, and he said no, I'm a guest.

      I know this shouldn't be worrying me, or making me feel bad, but what? I feel like I need to do something to earn my stay. Something to help cover me being here. Obviously I'm not going to just not ever do anything, but the fact that he is so generous is startling, but in a good way.

      Let's just say I am EXTREMELY blessed to be staying with Dietrich. I really think this is going to be a great time here in Magdeburg.
