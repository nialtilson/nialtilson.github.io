    <h2>Pictures</h2>

    <p>Here are the visual aides for the last bit. Some of a bench, some night wandering while contemplating life, and time with my mommy!</p>

    <a class="body_ctr" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152280207626424.1073741863.625211423&type=1&l=60fcec66ba">CBYX/PPP - 23 - MOMMY!!!</a>

    <h2>Rundown</h2>

    <p>Well, there's a fair amount of things that have passed in the last two weeks. A lot. I'll try and remember most of it.</p>

    <p>Two weeks ago, I had my B2 Language Level Test. There were 5 parts: Hearing, Reading, Writing, Grammar, and Speaking. It was spread over 3 days, and I went into it pretty relaxed. I thought I did pretty good. Long story short, after the oral portion last Friday (31.01) I ended up passing with the equivalent of a B+. Not as good of a grade as I thought, but hey, going from A1 to B2 in 6 months is quite an accomplishment. Let's hope the next 6 months have even more improvement!</p>

    <p>Last Saturday I jumped on a train and went to pick up my mommy from the airport!!! I was so excited to see her and show her Germany on her first trip to Europe!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/clVrZHch.jpg" alt="Mommy and Me at the Berliner Dom"></img>

    <p>She flew in, and we threw our stuff at the hostel (Mommy's first Hostel experience!), and started walking around. First stop, Currywurst (Mommy's first Currywurst experience!). Nom nom. Then we walked around downtown Berlin. I'm a terrible tour guide, but it was great showing her around, and giving her her first taste of Europe! We got to see a bunch of stuff, and got great weather for it too. Plus, seeing that pure excitement from her from such new surroundings was a great treat.</p>

    <p>Well, we spent Saturday night in Berlin and wandered around Sunday morning, checking out the Reichstag area, and then over to the East Side Gallery. After that, we got out of the cold, met up with Katherine, and grabbed some coffee. Later on, we jumped on a train and got back to Magdeburg in time for dinner. We had a big dinner with Dietrich and some friends, and it was interesting being an interpreter. Not sure I could ever do that for a living. Great food, fun times.</p>

    <p>Monday morning I had an interview in Hamburg (more info on that to come), so rather than waste a day, Mommy came with. I had my interview at 8.2 Consulting AG, and during my interview Mom went and wandered around. The interview went well, but I had to wait for an answer. Headed back to the hostel, hung out and changed, and back came Mom. The jet lag and stuff before the trip were still depriving her of rest, so she decided to take a nap. Can't blame her.</p>

    <p>Not wanting to sit around, and on my cool quest (to be explained later), I headed down to Bremen to check out the city and hang out with Amy, another friend from the program. This was my first time to Bremen, and it turns out it's quite a pretty city. I really liked the Rathausplatz, for some reason it just seemed a lot cooler and very unique compared to other ones I've seen. Well, we walked around, chatted, saw some cool stuff, and grabbed dinner at a brewery downtown. Good fun, then I headed back to Hamburg to get some sleep.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/nYFSAOch.jpg" alt="Bremen Rathausplatz"></img>

    <p>The next day we headed down to Erfurt, partly to finish off my cool quest, but mostly for both me and mommy to see a new city in the heart of Deutschland. Well, it is a gorgeous city. Definitely unique to other cities because of the landscape and the cool things there, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. According to my mom, cities like Erfurt and Weimar (moreso Weimar) are what she thought of when she thought of German cities. Quaint, full of history, and beautiful.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/89flWuCh.jpg" alt="Erfurt Market Street"></img>

    <p>So we explored Erfurt and Weimar, and my mom got to see two really beautiful cities. Along the way, we met up with more PPPlers in the area. Grabbed some beer with Scott, went out to ice cream with Adriana and Kwazi, and then grabbed dinner with those three and Sam. It's pretty cool having friends all over the place.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/89flWuCh.jpg" alt="Erfurt Market Street"></img>

    <p>Thursday we headed back to Magdeburg and hung out there Thursday and Friday. One thing, eating at Dietrich's was really cool. Having that cross-cultural interaction (what I was like at the beginning of the program) and the excellent hospitality was very encouraging and awesome to see. In Magdeburg, I was able to get some work done while Mom explored the (not so big) town of Magdeburg. We headed back to Berlin on Saturday because of her flight, and got to walk around Schloss Charlottenburg and grab some great food.</p>

    <p>The next morning I took her to the airport. It was hard to see her go, and caused a few tears from both of us. Either way, I was really sad. We had some fun, talked a lot, realized more and more that we are in VERY similar situations right now, and just had some time together. It was really great and we both needed it.</p>

    <p>Well, I was down after sending mom off back to the US. Thankfully, I got a pick me up with breakfast at Katherine's guest family's house. Every sunday they make pancakes for breakfast. So I jumped on that train quick and downed a little taste of home. Followed that up with a little bit of laziness, then met up with Hilary and walked around Tempelhof Airfield (crazy cool bing there), and then met up with Pat and walked around and grabbed some food and drinks. Great end to the Sunday and getting me back in the groove.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/RN6mJQah.jpg" alt="Tempelhof Runway"></img>

    <p>Well, now getting back to reality, I've just been getting things ready to head up to Hamburg. Work contract, Intern prep manual, finding a place to live, and getting all packed up have been what I've been busy with in the last few days. Overall, it's been really lazy and laid back, and pretty successful. Found a place to live, move up tomorrow (Wednesday), and start on Monday. So I'll have a couple of days to hang out. I wanna try and get my bike fixed. But we'll see how it goes.</p>

    <p>So yeah, that's what's been going on lately...</p>

    <h2>I GOT WORK, aka My Internship</h2>

    <p>While indulging in our sweet teeth in ice cream in Weimar, I got a call. Jumped outside, and turns out I got an internship offer!!! I was pumped!!! I'll be working for 8.2 Consulting AG, doing Project Management, Site Development, and Collision Analysis for Offshore Wind Farms. I'm really pumped to start working there. It'll be a great experience, hopefully something I really enjoy, and hopefully lead to something cool down the road. We'll see!</p>

    <p>Talking to Katherine's guest father made it even better. He works in renewable energy, and he said that 8.2 Consulting AG is a very well known firm in the industry, and that they are great. This made good news even better, and is getting me pretty excited to get things started. Let's just say I'm pumped for Monday to start. And even a little bit pumped to read through the 200-page education booklet.</p>

    <h2>Family</h2>

    <p>First off, it was absolutely great to see my mommy. I am so unbelievably proud of her for everything that she is going through an how she has powered through it. It ain't over, but she is doing awesome. And she has done so much for me in all aspects of my life, yet she just keeps going. I hope I can be as good of a parent as her when I have kids. Gah, my mom is the best!</p>

    <p>I love my family. It's not always sunshine and puppies, but they are my family. And I love them. The shitty thing is we're so far away. I'm in Germany, Mom's in Portland, Paula's in Pullman, and Alicia's in Chicago. Not exactly around the corner. The other shitty thing is that I won't be able to attend Peewee's graduation in May. That makes me sad. And one of the shitty things of us all being so far away is that the times we do see each other things are too concentrated. Despite how awesome my mom is, and how pumped I was to have her here, there were times where I just needed a break. Because we don't see each other that often, we have really intense times. And that sucks when the time is so rare. Gah. Frustration.</p>

    <p>Mommy and I had quite a lot of time to chat during her trip, and had some really great, and really diverse conversations. Life, family, current events, babies, everything. I really love my mom. I could not ask for a better, more down to earth, more helpful, awesome mom.</p>

    <p>But yeah, my family is awesome. Totally awesome.</p>




    

    <h2>Venice - Thoughts</h2>

    <p>As most travelers, websites, gurus, and whathaveyou will say, Venice is an absolutely gorgeous city! The pedestrians-only atmosphere paired with the gorgeous canals and constant water influence really creates a unique place to be, and I'm extremely happy that I got to see it before it goes underwater... </p>

    <p>I really loved it when we were just wandering around with no goal. It's an easy city to get lost in, and when you have a target/time constraint, it's going to lead to some frustrations. But, I am not sure I'll be going back any time soon.</p>

    <p>It is pretty much based on a tourist trap, and in a way, feels like every other European city. I am extremely glad we visited in the winter because there was barely anyone there. I overheard some Gondolier saying that there's about 50-60,000 people that live in Venice, and there are around 25 million people that visit it every year. Imagining it in the summer season is terrifying. And honestly, it can really be seen in a day.</p>

    <p>That said, that is MY opinion. Everyone has different tastes and different ideas of beauty/relaxing/enjoyable/etc. I encourage you to visit it and let me know how wrong I may be. And hey, who knows. Maybe I visited it at the wrong time or just didn't truly appreciate it. That's entirely possible.</p>

    <h2>Italy - Languages</h2>

    <p>I've never taken Italian before. Although I have some background in Spanish, that's a whole different language with some similarities to Italian.</p>

    <p>Well, I find it crazy how I can come to a country, not speak the language, and still communicate so well with new and old friends because of their prior language training. It makes me feel good that I can converse well with new people from another country. Meeting new people with such a variety of backgrounds really helps to shape people and expose them to new cultures, which I am EXTREMELY thankful that I have the chance to do this.</p>

    <p>But I feel bad that I can't speak their language... Granted, as long as communication lines are there and working, there isn't really a problem. But I felt like a) a fish out of water and b) a little ignorant because I had absolutely no clue what was going on when there was Italian being spoken. Long story short, it's added to my list of languages to learn next.</p>

    <h2>English - My Reservations</h2>

    <p>When I'm in public, I feel self conscious about speaking English, and essentially about being an American. I feel like our 'culture' is so distributed in the world, and with the stigma that American tourists usually give a bad impression, I feel self conscious that I might be roped in with those. Granted, sometimes it is the easiest or the only way to communicate with others, but I feel like I shouldn't be speaking it.</p>

    <p>I feel like this is a very irrational reservation, but I have it.</p>

    <h2>America - Progress</h2>

    <p>Lately, and through lots of great conversations with Zack, I've been expressing my doubts about my country. Granted, I am not the most informed or knowledgeable person there is. But from the things that I know, and what is going on in our country, namely our government, I am not pleased or optimistic. And doing this with a history major and someone well versed in our country's past is a tough thing.</p>

    <p>Zack's go to saying is 'Americas not the best, but were getting better!'. And honestly, I probably should feel that way too, but with what is going on and the status of our government, I have a hard time believing things are on the up and up.</p>

    <p>No country is perfect, as I am learning. Every country has their downfalls and weaknesses, that is guaranteed no matter when and where you are in history. But I'm not optimistic about the USA, and that saddens me.</p>

    <h2>Beards - Leadership</h2>

    <p>So Zack and I were boarding the plane in Venice, and somehow we got to the topic of beards, and if there is a correlation between the facial hair status of a leader and their positive impact on their role and on the world.</p>

    <p>Long story short:  Beards won.</p>

    <h2>Argument - A First Stand</h2>

    <p>As I mentioned in a previous blog post, I've never been one to argue. I'm just learning that taking a stand and having an opinion different than others is healthy, constructive, how it should be, and a good thing. Well, I think I had my first action of that recently.</p>

    <p>Something came up where the other person felt strongly about something that happened and the beliefs/ideas/motives behind it. After having to think about it for a bit (I hate not being good at thinking on my feet), I assembled my ideas and presented them to explain my reasoning/motives/ideas/etc.</p>

    <p>It may seem trivial, but I am really proud of myself for this. I showed myself that I can a) have my own opinions, b) keep my own opinions, and c) present them in a reasonable way. Go me.</p>

    <h2>Up Next</h2>

    <p>The internship search CONTINUES!!! These exclamation points are points are for emphasis, not excitement. A couple small developments here and there, but nothing is final yet. I'll be calling more companies here in the next couple days to hopefully get some kind of decision. But other than that, it keeps going and going and go....</p>

    <p>Next week we've got a seminar in Frankfurt, where everyone from the program will be meeting up! I'm really excited for this. There's a ton of people I haven't seen since before we left for language school, so I'm excited to catch up with all of them. That paired with being in Frankfurt, and having evenings to ourselves, I think we're gonna have a great time.</p>

    <h2>Beard Update</h2>

    <p>I'm only like a week and a half from a year-long beard!</p>
