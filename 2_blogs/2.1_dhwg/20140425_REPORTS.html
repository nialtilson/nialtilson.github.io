    <h1>REPORTS!!!</h1>
    <br>

    <p>Forgot to post this a while back. Unedited, and might not make sense. Oh well...</p>

    <h2>My Times</h2>

    <p>Life's been a steady mix of everything. Ups and downs riddled through my intercultural petri dish of a life.</p>

    <p>Work, nothing but reports. Translating is boring. Market reports on US and Turkey, but no motivation to do it, leading to very sporadic bursts of actual work.</p>

    <p>Sliced my pinky open cutting (never happens, but no one's perfect...). Headed to the ER the next day to get it checked out. German Hospitals make US Hospitals look/feel like a fucking joke. It was a totally stress free experience. No wait to get helped, paper work done in 5 minutes, someone called me from the wait bench in another 5, and I was in and out in the span of a half hour. That included getting my finger taped together, and having a delightful conversation with the older doctor about a ton of stuff. Politics, his time in the US, the potential of connecting a small wind turbine to the pump on his geothermal heating system at his vacation house, just delightful. And it was nice that I could keep up with the convo!</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>I used to not be a very social person. I had my people, but outside of that, it was a wash. Well, that has definitely changed over the last 5-10 years (holy shit I feel old that I can look back on that amount of time and recognize such differences in myself).</p>

    <p>This past week I've discovered something that I find really frustrating, and somewhat hurtful. It really gets to me when I lose contact with people, namely when they provide no response to me. It's absolutely irritating. I'm finding out how much value I put on timely communication, and not getting that from someone else really eats at me and hurts me.</p>
