    <h1>TODAY I FELT...</h1>
    <br>

    <p><em><a class="body" href="http://i.imgur.com/AgsGW.gif">..Like A Failure.</a></em>  I found an internship that I really, REALLY want on Wednesday, and today I put together my application. I was pumped. Well, true to style, I mucked it up by not putting the correct subject line in my email, which is explicitly layed out in the job posting. Way to ruin it Nial. Way to go.</p>

    <p><em><a class="body" href="http://i.imgur.com/6uFgNaO.gif">..Like A Commodity.</a></em>  I had an interview today with a potential guest family, and there was a GIZ rep there too. It was really weird, being asked about my whole life and my habits, and what I do during the day, if I'm a nice and orderly person, what kind of music I like, what do I normally eat..... Needless to say I felt really weird. And naturally, I couldn't think of any questions to ask until I left. So no return fire was made. Weird. And to top it off, they 'Sie'd me the whole time. That was weird.</p>

    <p><em><a class="body" href="http://i.imgur.com/suGwrCi.gif">..Like I'm Not Doing Enough.</a></em>  I feel like I could be doing so much more, or that I'm not doing enough to make the most of my time during the weeks. I go to lectures, then I usually go to the library to work on job applications. Of course there's a little bit of mindless time mixed in there, but what else can I be doing to maximize my time and meet new people? I'm never good at this, and I need to get better.</p>

    <p><em><a class="body" href="http://i.imgur.com/VUAWW.gif">..Like I Finally Got a Small Win.</a></em>  I met some cool dude last week that invited me to go to the FC Magdeburg match tomorrow with him and his buddies. Earlier this week he canceled due to a project. But, tonight I got a text saying the plans were back on. So I'm headed to a soccer match tomorrow and will hopefully make a few new friends while having some fun in the process. Woot.</p>
