    <h1> BOOM! LETS GOOOOOOO!!! </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      It just got real. The last couple days have sure been an eye-opener. This
      adventure that has been years in the making is really starting. REALLY
      starting. I knew it was coming but I didn't ever grip that it was going
      to be real, leaving what I know for a year to nothing but unknown. Holy
      crap.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last days in the PNW were good. Bittersweet but good. Great time with
      friends and time with my mom before I headed out. The airport was sad
      though, I've never had a tougher time leaving home, ever. I definitely
      wasn't expecting it to bring me to tears. But it did.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's some poetic beauty. So I had a direct flight from SEA to DCA.
      Where did that flight path take us? Right over CMH!!! I got one last
      glimpse of my C-bus before starting this whirlwind. Saw the whole city
      from the air: OSU, Downtown, all of it. Right in the feels...
    </p>

    <p>
      Friday I put in about 18 miles of walking and saw a ton of the sights:
      the White House, Washington Monument, WWII Memorial, Lincoln Memorial,
      Reflection Pond, Arlington National Cemetery, Kennedy's Tomb, Tomb of the
      Unknown Soldier, FDR Memorial, MLK Jr Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, the
      National Mall, the Museum of Art, the U.S. Capitol Building, and topped
      it off with a couple Half-Smokeys from Ben's Chili Bowl. Saturday was a
      little slower, Air and Space then Natural History Museums. I was a little
      tired. And it got uber rainy, so I stayed out of the downpour.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program officially starts tomorrow. Just over 24 hours away. Truth be
      told, I'm actually less anxious now than I was when I left Washington.
      Kinda weird, but I guess I just needed to get closer to the start to get
      more comfortable and prepared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how I feel, how prepared I am, what I didn't anticipate, I
      am going to starting a crazy journey. Damn I can't wait...
