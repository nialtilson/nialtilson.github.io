    <h1>FRIDAY WITH FRIENDS</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      My initial plan (from a few weeks ago) was to go down to München this
      weekend and revel in the beeriness of all that is Oktoberfest. But I
      didn't end up going down because of a potential to play in the
      Oktoberfest frisbee tournament in 2 weeks, and finances, and.........
    </p>

    <p>
      Last night I got a message from one of the guys on the Köln frisbee team,
      and he invited me over to his place with some of the guys for dinner and
      hanging out. Long story short, I had a blast!  Still low on the
      understanding spectrum, but it was great to hang out and keep working on
      understanding what's going on, as well as practice my speaking with them.
      We had burritos (OMNOMNOM) and hung out for a bit.

      Bittersweet, but I had to leave early to go meet up with T-Maack, aka
      Tall Thomas, at the Hauptbahnhof. He came down from Hamburg for the
      weekend to visit his family, and I got to grab a couple beers with him
      before he headed out to his Oma's place. It was great to catch up with
      him!  I hadn't seen him since the infamous SB'09 in Folly Beach, SC.

      Quite the great night. :-)
