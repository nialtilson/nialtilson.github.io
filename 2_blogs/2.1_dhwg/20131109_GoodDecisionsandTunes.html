    <p>So I stayed home this weekend rather than going to Amsterdam. Turned out to be a good idea thus far, although I would have loved to do both. Don't you just wish you could selectively clone yourself at certain periods in life and then experience two things at once (like the time-changer thingy that Hermione had in one of the HP books)? I would love that ability.</p>

    <h2 id="Poland">Another Visit to Poland</h2>

    <p>Last night I got to go back to Poland! But not the actual country, moreso the people. I met up with one of the guys in my German class, Manswet, and headed to his apartment to hangout with him, his roommates, and a couple friends. It was great meeting them, they're all great and fun people! We got to speak a fair amount of German, which is always a plus, but then I also got a battering of Polish (considering I was the only guy there that didn't speak it). Quite the interesting language!  \Nothing close to German (at least I didn't pick up any words), but crazy that these two languages have survived as neighbors!  Pretty cool to see.</p>

    <p>Also, as a further stop on my continuing tour through Poland, I got to try some homemade Polish vodka. Not gonna lie, it was better than any vodka I'd ever had. It had a little bit of lemon taste to it and was nice and smooth going down. Not being a fan of liquor, it was quite enjoyable.</p>

    <h2 id="Tunes">Tunes, Tunes, Tunes</h2>

    <p>Lately I've been really digging into some German music. And I'm loving it. Not only is it good music, but it's a constant language exercise for me. Obviously I can't understand everything, but being able to pick up words here and there and slowly get a feel of the language structure through music has been awesome.</p>

    <p>And overall it's really good music. Errybody noes that I am a fan of music. Earlier I was just jamming along to my same old music (nothing wrong with that), but it wasn't helping my German being constantly bombarded with English. So I'm really digging the fact that I've found great tunes that will help me work on this language mountain. Baller.</p>

    <p>Here's some samples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a class="body" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opoDBF_b-fg">Alligatoah - Willst Du</a>  (about a guy asking a girl if she wants to some drugs, pretty catchy)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="body" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAC-2ttHCyk">Sido - Bilder im Kopf</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="body" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAC-2ttHCyk">Trailerpark - Feldermausland</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="body" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPOgrtlc_ds">Prinz Pi - Kompass ohne Norden</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="body" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeHWMnHrH3s">Stromae - Rendezvous</a> (ok I get it, it's not German, but this dude can put out some music. Check out Formidable, and Alours an Dance. Really good stuff)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is only one downside,  I can't download this stuff due to German internet watchdogs and copyright stuff. They actually monitor it and make you pay here. But I've got something in the works where I might be able to jam out to this stuff no matta where I go. Speaking of Matta, LET'S GO BUCKS!!!</p>
