    <h1> TOMORROW WE LEAVE. WHAT?!? </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      It is 12:15am EST right now. I'm writing this on my last night in the
      U.S. of A. for a year. This is quite a weird feeling, and still doesn't
      feel like anything is really happening. It's still not a reality yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our flight leaves from DCA at 3:30pm EST tomorrow. That's when things
      get really real. I'm still not sure if I am really going on a year long
      trip, an intensive language school, living in KÃ¶ln and somewhere in
      Sachsen-Anhalt. What? I'm not sure when/if it is going to set in.
    </p>

      So we got our language school living arrangements at the start of the
      orientation seminar! I got a host family and I'm nervous/excited for
      what the experience will be like. Also, it is pretty close to downtown,
      so I'll be right in the middle of a very historic city. It is going to
      be a great experience!
    </p>

      Also, I got to meet with some of the aides for my congressman, Denny
      Heck. Unfortunately, the congressman was on a plane coming back to D.C.,
      but Seth and Erik in the congressman's office were a great group to talk
      to. I gave a little elevator speech on what the program is, thanking his
      office for their continued support and funding of the program! I also got
      into a little bit of the details on where I'll be and how the program
      will go. I would have really liked to meet with Congressman Heck, but I
      appreciate the helpful spirit and great attitudes of all those in his
      office.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll talk to you in Germany!!!
