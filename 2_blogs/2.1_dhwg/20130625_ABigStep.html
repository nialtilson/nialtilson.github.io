    <h1>A BIG STEP</h1>

    <h2>Where do I begin?</h2>

    <p>
      After a few years of applying, I am finally all set and on my way to
      Germany through the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange for Young
      Professionals! I am incredibly excited to get a chance to experience
      Germany in the next year and get a true taste of this awesome country.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is quite the transition period for me. After 5 years and 2 degrees
      at The Ohio State University, I am officially done. I graduated with my
      Masters in Mechanical Engineering on May 5, and three days later, I
      packed up all of my stuff and hit the road.
    </p>

    <p>
      I took almost 4 weeks and nearly 4600 miles to drive from Columbus, OH to
      Olympia, WA. Taking a really scenic and extended route, and visiting
      friends and family along the way, I didn't realize how badly I needed
      some time to myself with no limits or restrictions. My route was as
      follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Columbus, OH</li>
      <li>Cincinnati, OH</li>
      <li>Nashville, IN (Brown County State Park)</li>
      <li>St. Louis, MO</li>
      <li>Bentonville, AR (Slaughter Pen Trails)</li>
      <li>San Angelo, TX</li>
      <li>Boulder, CO</li>
      <li>Fruita, CO (18 Road Trails)</li>
      <li>Moab, UT</li>
      <li>Boise, ID</li>
      <li>Bend, OR</li>
      <li>Winchester, ID</li>
      <li>Seattle, WA</li>
      <li>Olympia, WA</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Needless to say, it was a GREAT vacation.
      Here's <a class="body" href="https://www.facebook.com/nial.tilson/media_set?set=a.10151722461426424.1073741826.625211423&type=1&l=321a204777">a link</a> to the rest of my pictures from the trip.
     </p>

     <p>
       But now I'm in Olympia until I go. I've been doing a lot of yard work
       and construction stuff for friends and family. I've had the last couple
       of days off, so I've been getting caught up on the clerical stuff and
       making sure I'm on track to leave for DC in ONE MONTH. Holy crap that's
       coming up fast.
     </p>

     <p>
       Unfortunately, I've been pretty lax on my German language prep. The
       road trip really killed it, and I've been keeping busy since I got back.
       I know it'll help me out, I know it'll give me a good head start for
       language school, but the slacker in me is really coming through pretty
       strong on this front.
     </p>

     <p>
       Otherwise, I am getting really pumped to start this program. I've been
       reading into the <em>Facts about Germany</em> book we got from the
       German Information Center, and getting some more insight into the
       country I'll be living in for a year. Among that, and keeping up with
       current events here and there, I'm doing my best to prepare some
       knowledge for conversation and such.
     </p>

     <h2>The Program</h2>

     <p>
       For those that don't know, or that need a refresher, or have no idea
       what this is all about, let me explain. This past spring, I was invited
       to participate in the <strong>C</strong>ongress-<strong>B</strong>undestag
       <strong>Y</strong>outh <strong>E</strong>xchange (CBYX) for
       Young Professionals. I will be participating in the 30th year of the
       program, and will be traveling to Germany for one year with 74 other
       young professionals from all throughout the U.S.
     </p>

     <p>
       The program will last for 12 months. The first two months will be for
       language school. The participants are spread out to 3 different cities
       to take intensive language courses for 2 months in order to get a firm
       grasp of the language before moving on in the program.
     </p>

     <p>
       Next, we move to a new city and begin the permanent placement phase.
       This will consist of 4 months of University classes, and then a 5 month
       internship. While we are taking classes, we will be in charge of
       securing an internship for the program. This means we could be doing
       anything, and depends on what we are able to find. After the internship
       phase is complete, we will have a couple of weeks to travel before we
       return to the U.S. The purpose of this program is to give participants
       exposure to the culture of Germany, and to build relationships with the
       people that we meet.
     </p>

     <p>
       While we are there we could be living with a host family, a dorm, or a
       shared apartment, and it really depends on where we are placed. The
       program is run by two organizations. In the U.S., all the planning is
       done by Cultural Vistas, but in Germany, all of the planning is done by
       the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (G.I.Z.).
       They are in charge of our placements and logistics during the program.
     </p>

     <p>
       I recently found out that I will be taking language school in KÃ¶ln,
       Germany (Cologne), and my permanent placement will be somewhere in the
       Bundesland (State) of Sachsen-Anhalt. It's a great treat to get some
       more details regarding the trip. And from what I've heard, both places
       have tons to offer and see. I get more and more excited for this
       adventure by the day!!!
