    <h1> WE WON THE GOLDEN PINEAPPLE!!! BUT NOW I NEED SLEEP </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      Last weekend was a blast!!! I got to play with Frühsport 0,2 at the
      Deutsche Meisterschaft im Ultimate, aka German Ultimate Frisbee National
      Championships.
    </p>

    <h2>Just Like Riding a Bike, Except There's No Riding, and It's Not a Bike</h2>

    <p>
      The first awesome thing, my legs didn't keep me from playing!!! Warming
      up and getting ready for games was a struggle because we always had at
      least an hour or longer break in between games. But once the game
      started, I was full speed ahead.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">Oh Yeah.</p>
    <br>

    <p>
      The second awesome thing was that this was a) my first tournament in over
      a year and a half, and b) my first real 3-day tournament, which just
      happened to be Nationals in Deutschland. Pretty sweet.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was great to get back in the frisbee swing, goddamn I've missed this
      sport. And playing with Frühsport only made me miss my time with
      Leadbelly that much more. It was a very different feel from playing with
      Lead. Playing with the same guys for 2-4 times a week for a few years
      gets you pretty comfortable with your teammates, how they play, how you
      play, how the system works, and how to get pumped and get ready to
      dominate. But here with Frühsport was way different (and not necessarily
      in a bad way): playing with them for only 3 weeks, little understanding
      of what people are saying, elementary understanding of their playing
      style and their system, and all that. But nonetheless, it was a blast. If
      for no other reason than I could claim ignorance and just go out and have
      fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, we didn't exactly play sooper hot. We were playing in the first
      league with the best teams in Deutschland. We lost all of our pool games,
      then lost our only bracket game on Saturday. But Sunday, oh baby on
      Sunday, we played the other team in the first league that lost all of
      their games for the Deutsche Meisterschaft Gelden Ananas. And we won!!!
      We won the Golden Pineapple!!! That was a fun game. It made me really
      remember how much I get pumped up for frisbee games. I got pretty into it
      and had a blast.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, I think I had three assists, one score, and one pretty sick sky
      over a guy on one of the better teams in our pool, and there's a good
      chance he played for the German National Team. So I've got that going for
      me...
    </p>

    <h2>Sleeping on the Wrong Side of the World</h2>

    <p>
      For some reason, I think it might have been the long and tiring weekend
      and a combination of so much Deutsch listening and failed speaking, I was
      absolutely beat and in a bit of a funk the last couple of days. I was
      dead tired after class on Monday, and ended up going to bed at 9pm and
      got my homework done in the morning. On Tuesday night I had the same lack
      of desire to do homework at night (I had other stuff to do during the
      day, I wasn't being lazy) so I decided to try and take a nap, and that
      nap transformed into bedtime at 10pm, but I had to get up early again to
      get my homework done.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having a totally fucked up sleep schedule really messed with me yesterday
      and this morning. I don't like being in funks like this. I feel like the
      world is kinda flipped upside down and things just get kinda weird. I
      don't like that. But thankfully tonight (Wednesday at time of
      transcribing) I think I'll be able to get a bit closer to being back on
      track. I got my homework done earlier, I will be staying up to a more
      normal time, and I don't have to get up early for anything. We'll see how
      this goes.
    </p>

    <p>
      And with that weird sleeping funk came other downers. Got kinda upset I
      haven't talked with my buddies back home in a while. I feel out of the
      loop (that is guaranteed to be a consistent feeling being on the other
      side of the world) and really feel like I'm not there for them as I have
      been in the past. I hate that feeling.
    </p>

    <h2>Moving Soon</h2>

    <p>
      This past week I've been a) working on my Lebenslauf (German Resume,
      still need to put it into another format) and b) getting in contact with
      the coordinators in Magdeburg and my new Gastvater. I move to Magdeburg
      next weekend. Weird. Really weird. And then I'll be there for 10 months.
    </p>

    <p>
      I still have yet to book my train ticket, and still need to do that,
      after I (still need to) email my new Gastvater and see when I should
      arrive and on which day. So there's still some ground work to be done.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's weird to think that I'm already leaving Köln. It feels like I just
      got here. But yet off I go. I'm kinda nervous about going to Magdeburg.
      After talking with a handful of Germans and them questioning what I am
      doing in their beautiful country and telling them my future, they always say that Magdeburg is 'hässlich', which is pretty much ugly. This is not a good sign to hear from the German people themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite all of the negative vibes I'm feeling, I'm going to go into this
      with a good attitude, tons of optimism, and be excited for the many
      opportunities that will hopefully open up for me!  I've already made two
      connections that will help me get on that road to fantasyland.
    </p>

    <p>
      This past weekend, one of the guys on my team told me he knew someone who
      lives in Magdeburg, and took me over to meet her. She is the coach (I
      think) of the Magdeburg club team, so I got a place to play and I'm
      guessing some cool people to meet once I get to Magdeburg. I also met a
      couple of Americans living in Berlin that play for Berlin's club team,
      and they invited me to play tournaments with them. So regardless of what
      else happens, it looks like I will have frisbee to fuel me on. That is
      something I can get pumped for.
    </p>

    <h2>Day After</h2>

    <p>
      So the stuff before this I wrote yesterday. I feel a lot better. I got a
      good night's sleep after a little time at the bar watching some Champions
      League soccer.
    </p>

    <p class="quickhit">
      <strong>Sidenote:</strong>  Champions League gives off a crazy similar
      feeling to March Madness. Last night there were 8 matches going on, all
      at the same time. There was one channel on that would jump between all of
      the games and show the highlights and the goals. It was pretty cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      But yeah, doing much better today. Got to chat with ZZTobs after class,
      had a yummy sandwich, and been chilling out after class.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next week I move to Magdeburg, so I'll shoot one more post off before
      then. Tschüss!!!
    </p>
