    <h1> FISH OUT OF WATER DROWNING IN BREAD </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      It's been two weeks, and EVERYONE can still tell Im the foreigner. It's
      to be expected, but damn do I feel like I stick out WAYYYY too much.
    </p>

    <h2>Sprechen Sie kein Deutsch?</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Example 1:</strong>  last Sunday I was walking home from the park,
      and I was hungry. Being in Deutschland, I had a strong craving for some
      currywurst; I hadn't had any since I had arrived. So I head to the Hbf
      because everything was closed. I roll up to Currywurst Express, and say
      „Ich möchte ein Currywurst mit Pommes, bitte. Und ein Gaffel" in pretty
      slow Deutsch. The guy answers in English, recognizing my accent and
      inability to speak fluidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Example 2:</strong>  I went to the Apple store to get my computer
      picked up after it was fixed. I spent a few minutes on the way there
      thinking about what to say auf Deutsch when I get there. As soon as I
      arrive I forget what to say and mumble and sound like a fool. They
      immediately start speaking English.
    </p>

    <p>
      Granted, this is going to happen very consistently until I a) can tell
      people to speak slower and in Deutsch to help me practice or b) I speak
      like a native German. Neither of these will probably happen for a while,
      so I need to keep working at it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be a helluva lot better off if every person had a reader board on
      their person so everything they say would be subtitled. I can actually
      get by pretty decently if I can read, but trying to hear and decipher
      words and meaning is something that is completely beyond me right now.
      Patience Nial, patience...
    </p>

    <h2>Posture Problems</h2>

    <p>
      The fact that I have access to a high quality public transportation
      system is something I could really get used to. Normally I just stand in
      the train cause I don't usually go to far. But when I sit down, I feel
      like every German on the train gives me their most disapproving glare at
      my terrible posture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I normally like to lounge a bit. If I am seated, I try to maintain a
      straight back and sit up straight. But I always start to sink back and
      somehow every seat turns into a La-Z-Boy. Well, whenever I lay back on
      the u-Bahn, I feel like I start seeing evil eyes.
    </p>



    <h2>Alles ist Brot</h2>

    <p>
      I've never had anything against bread. It is the foundation to
      sandwiches, it makes a great bowl for clam chowder, with many other
      wonderful and delicious uses. But holy bejesus, in Deutschland bread is
      almost as prevelant as air and beer. Rolls for breakfast, lots of bread
      with a little meat is considered a sandwich, pretzels everywhere (not
      hatin on pretzels, it just fits with my argument), and just bread, bread,
      bread. I don't know how the Deutsch do it and stay so healthy, but they
      do. The last couple of days I've been trying to take a break from it,
      getting more fruit and veggies to counterbalance all of the bread.
      Sidenote: I had a great breakfast of cheese, meat, and tomato slices this
      morning. Really hit the spot.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's really not much I can do about all of this other than have
      patience and learn to accept it. My German is slowly improving. My
      posture, that's a personal battle, ill just have to accept the looks.
    </p>

    <p>
      On a lighter note, after I went and picked up my computer yesterday I
      stopped by a field where some frisbee goes down. I talked to them for a
      bit and it looks like I found a group to play with while I'm in Köln!
      Super pumped about this! Even though I haven't played in about a year,
      I'm stoked to get back on the field.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, Operation Fahrradfinden is not progressing as well as I had hoped.
      I found a pretty nice bike on German Craigslist Kalaydo but I think it
      was already sold. Persistence is going to be very important here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today for class I'm writing a blurb about Olympia. We're going over
      descriptions and stuff like that (a whole mess of words and whatnot) so I
      was picked to write a little narrative about my hometown. I chose some
      pictures I share with the class too to show what O-Town looks like. It'll
      be kinda cool to have people from with world see my hometown.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pool party tonight, hiking on Sunday, and who knows what else is in store
      or this weekend. Time for some fun!
