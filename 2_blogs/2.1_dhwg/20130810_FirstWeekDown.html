    <h1> FIRST WEEK DOWN, A LONG WAY TO GO </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      Pretty much sums it up right there. One full week at language school with
      a big list of ups and downs.
    </p>

    <h2>In Over My Head</h2>

    <p>
      We had the oral placement test last weekend, and with my self-taught
      Deutsch I got placed in A2 (the language proficiency is
      A1-A2-B1-B2-C1-C2). I thought it was going to be fine but I only lasted 3
      days in there. They were going over past tense and stuff I'd never even
      thought about, christ, I haven't even learned the German alphabet let
      alone special verb tenses. So I got switched into the second half of the
      A1 course which is much better for me. We're going over Akkusativ und
      Nominativ, which is what I need. It's better I get a foundation and
      understanding of the basics before I get ahead of myself.
    </p>

    <h2>Total Change of Mindset</h2>

    <p>
      When I was in the A2 class, I think my bigger struggle was trying to put
      words into sentences. Sounds stupid, but it's true. I had no prior
      experience of actually speaking the language. So anytime I tried to talk
      it was a struggle to figure out what I was trying to say, and it will be
      that way for quite a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      Something I finally realized is that I am going to need a whole different
      mindset for speaking to be fluent in Deutsch. Sentences are structured in
      a completely different way than what I'm used to. The second verb in a
      sentence goes at the end of the sentence, something I never did in
      English or Spanish. It's really weird and has been hard to try and get
      used to. Right now, I speak so slowly that a) whoever is listening needs
      really good long term memory and b) half the time I forget what I was
      trying to say anyways. It'll get better, but it's gonna take a while. And
      anyone who actually knows me knows that my middle name ain't Patience for
      a reason...
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Acquainted and Stuff</h2>

    <p>
      My host family is still the bomb. I've been able to do a little of
      speaking practice with my host sister and the other language student that
      is living in the house. It's kinda nice having someone to talk with that
      has a lot of patience and can help when I stumble. That and we watched
      Hauro, a Japanese anime film, in Deutsch. That was interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
      We went on a city tour yesterday given by our language school tutor. It
      was very interesting hearing about the history of KÃ¶ln. It was founded in
      50 AD by Agrippina and then she married Caesar (I think). When it came to
      deciding who would be the next leader, she killed her husband so her son
      could be the next leader, then her son killed her cause she was getting
      too power hungry. Crazy family problems. That and there are still gates
      and wall portions that are 800+ years old. Then we learned that the Dom
      took over 400 years to complete an is still technically not done. There
      is so much history here. And I've only begun exploring it all!!!
    </p>

    <p>
      Just on the bus to Frankfurt for the day. There is a CBYX-PPP alumni
      barbecue today that me and a few other PPPlers are going to. Should be a
      fun time, and hopefully ill get some good speaking practice!
