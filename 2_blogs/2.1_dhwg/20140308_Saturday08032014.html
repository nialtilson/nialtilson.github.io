    <h1>SATURDAY, 08.03.2014</h1>
    <br>

    <p>Today was a GREAT day. Absolutely great day. Why, you ask?</p>

    <p>I helped my landlady do some work in the garden. Poured some concrete and did stuff she didn't know how to, thereby using my skills to help others. Baller way to start the day.</p>

    <p>The weather was AMAZING. No clouds, pure sun. A little wind with constant warmth. Spring is here and Summer is on it's way.</p>

    <p>It is now officially Flip-Flop Weather. FUCK. YES.</p>

    <p>My old headphones were finally back and I had a way to groove to some tunes all day.</p>

    <p>My 'Top-Rated' playlist was jamming on shuffle. The perfect song, one right after the other.</p>

    <p>I don't know what I'd do without a bike, and today was no exception. My trusty (albeit imperfect) steed performed exquisitely.</p>

    <p>I got to explore a little bit of my new city.</p>

    <p>This new city has excellent biking/walking trails.</p>

    <p>My sense of adventure and exploration led the way all day.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MMzxytY.jpg" alt="Bike and Flops"></img>

    <p>I found a cool, new, random park on the other side of town.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fgxJ3j3.jpg" alt="Shadow from the Bridge"></img>

    <p>All things combined to give me perfect napping conditions. Outside, on the grass, in a park, next to a lake, in the sun...................</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FaLU9od.jpg" alt="Lake Nap Time"></img>

    <p>An exquisite meal to put swanky restaurants to shame that nearly put me to sleep at the table.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/86xqKS7.jpg" alt="Exquisite Food Coma"></img>

    <p>Today, I experienced a contented happiness that I haven't seen in a while. It was so relaxing, refreshing, and exhilarating to enjoy every second of the day and just feel so comfortable and in the zone all day.</p>
