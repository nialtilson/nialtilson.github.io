    <h1>POSITIVE NOTES YESTERDAY</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      So the last couple days were pretty good. It started out on Sunday with a
      day of studying and napping in the park. It was a beautiful day, I went
      through about half of our workbook to get Vocab and verbs, I got a great
      nap in, and I got my laundry done. A couple friends stumbled by while I
      was there and made for a nice study break, overall a huge success at the
      park.

      After that I took the u-bahn into the main part of town and decided to
      walk home. I stumble upon a couple of friends for a bit, then on my walk
      I got some currywurst (Omnomnomnomnomnom) and had a beautiful walk home
      along the Rhein. Great day.

      Yesterday, I had afternoon class, but I went into school early to keep
      going on my practice. I got a fair amount done and then went to the store
      to get a notebook and flashcards. Then I had class, which went pretty
      well. Sometimes it feels a little slow because there's a few people in
      class that are clearly not there to learn and put forth little to no
      effort, but there's not much I can do about that.

      Good study time at school, followed by a couple beers with friends, then
      I came home to do my homework. Got some done then had dinner with the
      host family and a miracle happened!!! I could somehow follow the majority
      of the conversation!!! Granted, they dumbed everything down when they
      spoke to me, but I understood it!!! Then I finished my homework, made a
      few more flashcards, then hit the sack. Going to bed feels sooooo amazing
      after a long and tiring day.

      <strong>Sidenote:</strong> if anyone wants to come and rub a handful of
      kinks out of my shoulders, I will return the favor. For some reason, I
      think the stress and walking and my backpack have led to a new level of
      stiffness in my neck and shoulders that I am not too fond of. Offer's out
      there...
