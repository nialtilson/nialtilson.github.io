    <h1> VON KOELN BIS MAGDEBURG </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      My time in Köln has come to an end. After two months in a city, I didn't
      realize how attached I could become and how hard it could be to leave
      such a great place and such great people.
    </p>

    <h2>Frisbee Bis Bald</h2>

    <p>
      This week was my last week at practice with Frühsport 0,2, the Köln
      frisbee team. Thursday was my last practice, and it was a blast. We
      scrimmaged the whole time, and it was the perfect balance of serious and
      fun. Everyone was having a great time while still being able to joke
      around and heckle each other. That kind of balance is hard to find. The
      last game to three my team was trying to make me score every point
      because it was my last time there. In that game I got two D's and two
      scores, so not too bad.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the less than two months with Frühsport, I have discovered a few
      things. First, I can't describe how grateful I am to have frisbee in my
      life. Not only is it something I enjoy and am not terrible at, but is
      also a great way for me to exercise, stay active, and have fun doing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two and three go hand in hand. It is a great way to meet new people, and
      the frisbee community is great no matter where you go!  Honestly, I don’t
      know how I would have met this many other great people in Köln if it
      weren’t for frisbee!  From my first day there, they were absolutely
      great. They helped me with my German, laughed at me when I couldn’t
      understand a thing, showed me the great frisbee culture that thrives here
      in Deutschland, and invited me into their lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was hard leaving practice knowing that it was my last. But I am very
      grateful for the chance to play with these great people and share the fun
      that comes with our sport.
    </p>

    <p>
      So a big shout out and a massive Vielen Dank to Marcel, Willy, Phillip,
      Benno, Phillip, Lars, Lutz, Dennis, Berndt, Roman, Kevin, Mischa, Achim,
      Torben, Vera, Marie, Theresia, Ana, Maria, Lukas, Max, Tom, Jens, Simon,
      Rollo, Pierre, and all of the other new friends that I have made!  You
      guys are truly great people and I look forward to seeing you again soon!!!
    </p>

    <h2>CBYX/PPPler Group</h2>

    <p>
      Yesterday was my last day at the Carl Duisberg Centrum language school.
      It was a bittersweet day. Not only was it the last time I’d get to see my
      classmates from the last two months on a daily basis, but also the great
      and amazing fellow PPPlers that I have had the pleasure of being with and
      making some great memories every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      After my last practice with Frühsport, I went over to The Rhein to hang
      out with some PPPlers that got dressed up for a classy night in Köln. We
      had some fun along the river. It was also kinda sad because we started
      the goodbyes. As always, once you get close to people, it makes it even
      harder to say goodbye.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that trend continued on to last night. There was an international
      dinner at the CDC, and at the end it just kinda turned into a hugging
      fest with everyone saying goodbye to everyone else. It’s not officially
      goodbye, it’s a see you soon. But still, it’s going to be a big change
      now that we won’t all be surrounded by each other. The crutches come off
      right now.
    </p>

    <h2>Retrospect</h2>

    <p>
      In a way, I feel like my life has been in a constant state of change.
      Even if I just take the last year into account, I feel like I’ve been
      just a temporary dweller in most places. Last year, I knew I was going to
      finish Grad School, and had a strong hunch I wouldn’t be staying in
      Columbus. In March I got the news I’d be going on this adventure, and in
      May I said farewell to 5 years worth of quality people and memories.
      After that long of a time it’s never easy to bid farewell to so many
      great people. What I knew and was used to was now all of a sudden on the
      other side of the country.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I got to spend just under 2 months in Washington. A few weeks of
      time with my old amazing friends exploring the region I grew up in, and
      getting to spend some time with my mom at a very pivotal time. Another
      period of time to make some great memories and reminisce on old memories
      suddenly cut short. This time I didn’t end school; I started this crazy
      worldwide adventure. Good friends like these are always there. But now
      what I know and am used to is now all of a sudden on other side of the
      world.
    </p>

    <p>
      I guess that is just going to be the story of my 20’s, and who knows,
      maybe my life (though I really hope not). I have no idea what is actually
      going to happen to me in the future, or where I might be going. I know
      the next 9 months will be in Magdeburg, and that’s really it. After that,
      no clue. I have an extremely vague and hazy idea of what I’d like to do,
      but no definite details about my future. Being me, I like to plan things
      out, have a road map, or at least a vague idea of potential actions.
      Right now it’s all up in the air.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I were in this situation a few years ago I would have been stressed
      beyond belief. Thankfully, with the many trials and learning experiences
      of these last couple years, I think I’ve become not so stressed, worried,
      or antsy over what may come. I know time isn’t slowing down. I know I
      need to find a job somewhere. But I know I need to enjoy the ride and
      have fun along the way. Aren’t you proud of me Mommy!?! :-)
    </p>

    <h2>Köln, Vielen Dank</h2>

    <p>
      The last two months have been an absolute blast exploring a new city.
      Köln is truly a beautiful place with tons to do and great people to show
      you the ropes. I can honestly say that I am blessed to have lived there,
      and really look forward to visiting again soon.
    </p>

    <h2>Magdeburg, A New New Beginning</h2>

    <p>
      Here I sit, on this train, going through the heart of Deutschland. I am
      on my way to a new city. The city of Magdeburg, the capital of the
      Bundesland Sachsen-Anhalt. It will be a big change from Köln. West
      Germany to East Germany, liberal mentality to a more conservative
      mindset, a huge metropolis to an average-sized city, and more changes
      along those lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a way, I am really unsure of what to expect. The Germans that I have
      talked to regarding Magdeburg have all had different opinions. A lot of
      them were quick to point out their distaste and opinion that it isn’t
      very pretty. Others have told me that it is a gorgeous place to see. But
      right now, I’m on my way to find out.
    </p>

    <p>
      All I know is that, as I learned at the first meeting of any student
      organization I’ve ever been a part of, I am going to get out of it what I
      put into it. If I sulk and complain the whole time, yeah of course it’s
      going to be subpar. But that’s not how this is going down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, it’s not always where you are, but whom you’re with. I am excited
      to hopefully establish some great friendships there and to really get to
      know the people of Magdeburg. People are what can really bring things
      full circle.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m going to make the most of every opportunity I see and be the fun,
      happy person that I am in every situation I encounter. Whether that is
      when I’m having a great day or really struggling and feeling alone. As I
      said to a lot of the guys on the frisbee team, I’m going to be optimistic
      with this new adventure.
    </p>

    <p>
      So ends the first phase, and so begins the second phase of the 2013-2014
      CBYX/PPP Program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
