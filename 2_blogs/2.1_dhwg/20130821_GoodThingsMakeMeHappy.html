      Good things usually make people happy, right? Well, the last two days
      that has been the case for me. Good people, good results, good events,
      good food, all of that wrapped up in a multiple hour package, and I've
      been able to enjoy it quite thoroughly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Wheels">Two Wheels make All the Difference</h2>

    <p>
      As I hope you know, I kinda like bikes. All throughout college I had my
      bike with me pretty much constantly. I rode it to class every day, I rode
      it on single track in Ohio, working on it was a great release from all
      the stress, it was a pretty integral part of my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      So naturally, there was no way I was going to go a whole year without
      having a bike to ride. Not a chance. So I did some research, and it turns
      out, Germans have a thing called Kalaydo. It's pretty much German
      Craigslist. The first search I ran I found a pretty good bike, so I sent
      an email inquiring about it. Kept looking, kept looking, and no better
      ones really popped out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long story short, they replied, I replied, they replied, I replied, then
      I went and got the bike!!! It was a little expensive, but I was pumped to
      have a bike. On the ride home though, I noticed quite a few more problems
      that popped out that didn't show on my test drive. The front wheel was
      completely warped, the gears were stuck, the disc brakes were poorly
      aligned, and it just needed a fair amount of work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another long story short, I ended up taking the front wheel in to a local
      Fahrradladen (bike store) to see if they could true it for me. The guy
      gave me a free part (the old nipple was sheared in half, and gave me the
      tools to get started. So I didn't have to pay a cent to get my wheel back
      in order!  Nice people make things awesome.
    </p>

    <p>
      Along with that, and the tools, fenders, lock, and stuff that I got, I
      got that bike into tolerable working order. I've still got some work to
      do, and I might get a new saddle. But for right now, I'm a happy boy. It
      was nice to be able to work on something with my hands and come out with
      a successful final product. Planning on taking it out this weekend to
      somewhere away from the city to have an enjoyable ride. Overall, I'm
      PUMPED to have something to ride. And something nice to ride.  :-)
    </p>

    <h2 id="Frisbee">FINALLY Back on the Field</h2>

    <p>
      Grad school was quite the drag on me. One of the hardest parts was not
      being able to play Ultimate due to the workload. After 4 years of 3-5
      times a week and numerous weekends every month being consumed by great
      people and a great sport, it was saddening and really did a number on my
      body by not having it to turn to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, I finally got a little more settled in, and with the help of my
      gentle giant friend T-Maack, I located a group to potentially play with!
      Last week Thursday, I had to go get my computer picked up from the Apple
      store, so I stopped by this group on the way home. Talked to one of them,
      and they said it was cool if I played while I was in KÃ¶ln.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I went after class yesterday and was incredibly pumped to play. I got
      there pretty early, so I did some homework beforehand, but people started
      showing up so I got ready to play!  My throws were still pretty good, but
      holy crap am I out of shape. That was kinda sad, my legs are still
      ridiculously sore and I feel like I haven't worked out in forever (which
      is kinda true). Regardless, I got to play, it was awesome, and I can't
      wait to keep going to this while I'm here!!!  Frisbee people are cool the
      world over.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Food">Food with the Gastfamilie</h2>

    <p>
      My host family is leaving on Sunday for two weeks in Italy. Jealous is
      definitely one emotion that comes to mind when they talk about it. But
      more importantly, I'm pretty sad they are going. They've been a HUGE
      help, and an amazing practice ground for me to listen to conversations,
      and speak the little bit of Deutsch that I do know. I sure hope learning
      through Osmosis is a real thing, cause they are definitely helping
      contribute to that process.
    </p>

    <p>
      But yeah, so they're leaving on Sunday, and we had a big dinner tonight
      to celebrate, in a way. It was delicious!  Homemade lasagna, with some
      kind of dessert thing afterwards, and they kept pouring me more beer, and
      sheesh, it was awesome!!! It makes all the difference in the world when
      you have great people to be around, and they definitely fit the bill for
      that!!!
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      In summary, I'm thankful for a bike to ride. I'm thankful that I have a
      place to play frisbee and hopefully start getting back in shape (and pray
      I stay healthy!). I'm thankful for a great host family and all of their
      help and support, whether they realize it or not. And most of all, I'm
      friggin pumped to be just starting this year out. It's gonna be a crazy
      journey, but goddamn is it going to be worth every second!!!
