    <h1> DISCOVERING (AND SLOWLY FIXING) MY DOWNFALLS </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      One thing they mentioned at the start of this trip is how an experience
      like this can truly be a life changing trip, and in many ways. Well I'm
      starting into the 'getting to know yourself' phase. This whole Deutsch
      lernen thing has been pretty stressful and frustrating, and that with
      some other things would be a whole helluva lot easier if I had one
      personal trait in my repertoire.
    </p>

    <h2>Patience would be a Virtue</h2>

    <p>
      Anyone who knows me well has probably seen it come forward at some point
      or another. I am normally not a very patient fellow. Sometimes it can be
      good (that or I'm just trying to soften a big personal flaw). But
      recently it has been a hinderance to a few different things that should
      probably be a non-issue. But nooOOOOOoo. I gotta make things hard on
      myself for no good reason.
    </p>

    <p>
      First off is my impatience with people. I think I've known this for a
      while, but when I find someone annoying or they rub me the wrong way, I
      become extremely impatient with them. This is becoming a problem for me
      because a) it leads to pointless worrying, intolerance, and unneeded
      stress in my day and b) can affect my total demeanor thereby leading to
      bad mojo going around. Stupid, pointless, unneeded anger that should not
      be there in the first place. Gotta learn to be more forgiving, less
      worried and bothered, and be more accepting of other people. I'm not
      sure how I got so egocentric on stuff like this, but is completely
      unnecessary, especially because I'm probably as much, if not more
      annoying, than everyone around me. So if I can't take it, I sure as hell
      shouldn't be dishing it out. I learned that a helluva long time ago and
      my concrete skull still hasn't put it into play.
    </p>

    <p>
      Second is my impatience related to trying to learn this Deutsch that
      constantly escapes me. And it is not only impatience, but my desire to
      not make others impatient. What I mean by that is my aversion of
      confrontation/not wanting to annoy people. In the times that I do get to
      speaking Deutsch, I rush myself 90% of the time in an effort to keep
      speaking and get my point across to the other person that I end up making
      a ton of mistakes (structurally and phonetically) that hinder any
      progress in learning this. For this I gotta slow down. (I know Mom, I
      know...)  I've got to take my time, enunciate, make sure I'm pronouncing
      each word correctly, and not rush myself through sentences. But rather, I
      should calmly and collectively say what I am trying to say in an effort
      to slowly build up my proficiency of the language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Impatience with people leads to unnecessary frustration and a poor
      attitude. Impatience when speaking leads to more mistakes and a longer
      learning period. Neither of these are going to help me out in any way
      throughout this year. So for those of you in my program, please call me
      out when any of this happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>EDIT:</strong>  I'm even getting to the point where I'm
      complaining to myself about how much slower the internet is here compared
      to the U.S. Impatience has become my new middle name, and I'm not exactly
      proud of it.

    <h2>Frisbee auf Deutsch</h2>

    <p>
      Update in my frisbee life here in Deutschland. Last Thursday at practice,
      I was asked to join the team at the German Club Nationals tournament next
      weekend. (WHAHAHAAAAAA?!?!?!?!)  So I'm pretty pumped for that, as it
      should be a helluva time.
    </p>

    <p>
      And this past weekend, I headed up to Travemünde, pretty close to Lübeck,
      for a beach tournament with a handful of Frisbee folk from Köln. It was a
      blast!  The weather was ok (scattered showers and times of sunshine), the
      venue was gorgeous (I think I saw Denmark from the beach), there was tons
      of huge ships and ferries passing by the fields so I had something cool
      to gawk at every once in a while, and I got a TON of time to try and work
      on my German.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the time it was me desperately trying to get a grasp of the
      conversation and ended up just picking out words that I recognized and
      being proud of myself for that. Other times it was me being puzzled at
      what people were saying just because it was so dang fast and I couldn't
      decipher where words ended and began. But there were a few times where I
      think I held a somewhat acceptable conversation!!!  It was cool to try
      and keep working on this language, and if nothing else, I sure hope
      learning by osmosis is a real thing.
    </p>

    <h2>Planning for some Fun</h2>

    <p>
      This weekend is going to be an absolute blast. All I'll say right now is
      it involves 3 other people, probably 4 (maybe 5) countries, a rental car,
      and a whole helluva lot of fun. Oh. Baby.
    </p>

    <h2>PICTURES!!!</h2>

    <p>
      A small album from the frisbee tournament this weekend:

    <p>
      Also, for those that are into viral videos, here's how you would say
      "ain't nobody got time for that" auf Deutsch:  "Es gibt niemanden, der
      zeit dafür hat".
