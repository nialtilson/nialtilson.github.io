    <h2 id="Quick">Real Quick</h2>

    <p>I've been failing at keeping this going lately. Sorry! A lot of things are starting to pile up, with the end of the program, trying to maximize my time here, and quite a few other good and bad things.</p>

    <h2 id="DONG">DONG Interview</h2>

    <p>Well, since it's been such a long time, I've got a lot to cover. Let's go back a couple weeks to a really tiring Thursday I had.</p>

    <p>I was invited to interview with DONG (Danish Oil and Natural Gas) Energy for their Graduate Development Program. That involved me getting up at 3am on April 10 to fly to Copenhagen for the day for an interview. I got all ready and made my way to the airport, only to remember that I forgot my passport... Thankfully, that wasn't a problem. Good thing Europe is cool about that. Also, Scandanavian Airlines has THE COMFIEST airplane seats I've ever experienced. Major plus.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CO7RyqEh.jpg" alt="Flight to Copenhagen"></img>

    <p>I got in a while before things started, so walked around a park near the building. Then the Assessment Day got started. We got info about the company, program, and business unit. It's definitely an ambitious company with big eyes on the future (although their growth plan is completely contradictory). Unfortunately not all of it is focused on renewable energies, but a good portion of the future developments are planned for offshore wind.</p>

    <p>Right after lunch was my interview. It was with my would-be manager and an HR rep. It started off with me pretty much explaining my resume, what I've done, where I've been, etc. that was fun being able to just talk about me. Overall, I think that part went ok.</p>

    <p>As part of the application process, they had us take two tests, one was a logic indicator, the second was a personality test, but on work-related situations and mind sets. We spent the rest of the interview discussing my results here.</p>

    <p>The logic thing turned out pretty well. Out of the 45 questions I answered, I got 40 questions correct. So compared to people with similar backgrounds (Master's recipients, et. al.) I got in the top bracket, and more specifically, in the top 3%. That's not too bad I'd say...</p>

    <p>The second evaluation was interesting. The test, through my answers, generated a ton of statements about me and my personality. A lot of them, they got pretty accurate. A few of them, however, were completely off. For the majority of them, I had to back them up and give examples of why they were or were not correct. This was a little hectic. I feel like I didn't have a good explanation of myself and did not provide very good examples. The manager was pretty confused about my mindset and goals.</p>

    <p>But that's the problem, I have no idea what I really want to be doing or working on. I feel like that is a big negative about me. I can't just say what I want to be doing, or what type of work would be most enjoyable to me. I just don't know that yet. And I think that was causing some confusion. Damn.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/fEpk7Tth.jpg" alt="DONG HQ"></img>

    <p>I also got more information about the actual job. So I'd have two rotations, both in the Strategic Projects division of the Wind Group. They essentially solve big problems for the wind group and keep things on track in a cost-effective manner. My first rotation would be broad and at the upper level. Second part would be focused in on one project. This was different than what I was expecting (working on getting new wind farms up and running), but could still be interesting.</p>

    <p>Well, the next part we got stories from past/current participants in the program. That was interesting hearing from that perspective. It seems like it is a VERY time intensive and stressful program. Most definitely an extremely strong career stepping stone, but most definitely no walk in the park. That shocked me at first, I don't know why, but would definitely be something I can handle.</p>

    <p>The last portion was pretty awesome. We worked with LEGOs. My kind of interview. First part was pitting together a set according to instructions (easy peasie, I have the same set at home...). Second was building a bridge. That was some interesting group work. Third was building something to represent you (I built a multi-use crane), and fourth we built a model of the company's future growth and goals. I just wanted to play with LEGOs but couldn't let myself get consumed; people were judging me.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/qkr6cGSh.jpg" alt="Interviewing with LEGOs"></img>

    <p>Whether or not I get it, I didn't realize how lucky I was to get an interview. For 23 positions they got altogether around 2400 applications. Out of the roughly 100 ppl per spot, after the evaluation tests, they invited 3 to come interview. Pretty cool.</p>

    <p>Overall, I don't know. I think it went ok. My interview was weak, and could see how I come across as wishy-washy. I just don't have a rigid idea of what I want to do, but would love to do a variety of things to find that out. But who knows, I'll get some feedback in the next couple weeks, and if I get offered the position, I'll have a contract to sign mid-May. It's up in the air, if I get it cool, if not, something else will come up as a good fit for me.</p>

    <p>UPDATE:  As I was on the train down to Southern Germany, I got an email from the manager that interviewed me. I called her up, and long story short, I didn't get the position. She said I made a great impression and that I have a bright future, but they decided on a different candidate for that position. Oh well. I'm not too bummed, there were a few things about the company and the position that didn't seem ideal, but regardless, it would have been a great position. Just gotta keep fighting.</p>

    <h2 id="Schwarzwald">Weekend in the Black Forest</h2>

    <p>That next morning, I woke up, made a comfort breakfast of scrambled eggs with everything in it, and then lazily jumped on a train down south! It was a lazy train ride.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">
      <strong>Sidenote:</strong> The central region of Germany is absolutely gorgeous. Even though I've only ever ridden through it in a train, the scenery is absolutely serene. It's filled with large rolling hills and greenery. Absolutely gorgeous.
    </p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MrEruQ8h.jpg" alt="Ducks in Stuttgart"></img>

    <p>I got into Stuttgart, and met up with Dawn after she got out of work, then we headed to Reutlingen and hung out with Kwazi for the night. The next morning, we were off to Freiburg!!!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/JANFhjTh.jpg" alt="Blumen"></img>

    <p>We spent Saturday wandering around Freiburg. And I must say, that is an absolutely beautiful city!!! It's surrounded by hills and mountains (ZOMFG!!!!!!!), and the greenery made it just gorgeous. First we threw our stuff down at the hostel, then did some wandering. We walked through the Innenstadt, then explored some really cool side streets (there was one with strands of lavender overhead, it was pretty and smelled great).</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MdFRmfSh.jpg" alt="Freiburg Canals"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/zdd8DhGh.jpg" alt="Trees Across the Alley"></img>

    <p>And no day is complete without a visit to a beer garden. We stumbled upon Feierlings, and were totally lucky. They make a very unique wheat beer, and it absolutely hit the spot!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0bB6ZtCh.jpg" alt="Hausbrauerei Feierling"></img>

    <p>After we were recharged and ready to go, we hit the road again. This time, we made our way up to the top of a hill right next to the city. There was a lookout tower we wanted to go up. We made our way up, and just our luck, the thing was closed because of some pollen somethingorother. Regardless, that was annoying. But we made the most of it, wandered around the top of the hill, found what used to be a castle or something, and had an awesome rest of the night!!!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/yfharyfh.jpg" alt="Freiburg from Above"></img>

    <p>The next day I reverted back to 6 years old (not like I ever act mature anyways...). After a slow rise, we made our way deeper into the Schwarzwald and explored a beautiful little town. The name? Titisee. SO. GLORIOUS!!! I could not stop making jokes about it all day.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fQcI5Z2h.jpg" alt="Titisee... heeheehee"></img>

    <p>All things and immature jokes aside, it is a beautiful little town. We walked around the lake side, I tried to skip some rocks (the selection was pretty poor), and then we walked around the sides of the lake. In the afternoon we found a nice little patch of grass and posted up for a quaint little picnic and a nap. Prima.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eOXSiCXh.jpg" alt="Snacks by the Lake"></img>

    <p>As I said, it is a beautiful little town. A nice day of enjoyment and relaxation in good weather with great scenery really does a body good.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/T0ULdeyh.jpg" alt="Titisee"></img>

    <p>But, after that, I made my way back to Hamburg. My train left Stuttgart at 23:00, so we made our way there. I got super lucky, and snagged a cabin to myself, so I was able to sprawl out and sleep the whole way home. Good thing too, because I had work in the morning.</p>

    <h2 id="Easter">Easter Weekend</h2>

    <p>That next weekend (aka this past weekend, April 18-21) was packed with fun and friends. Work during the week was boring and slow, but Thursday came and the fun started.</p>

    <p>Colin (fellow Washingtonian and PNWer) came up from Wiesbaden for the weekend, and was joined by Zack and Katherine, who were both able to come out for the first couple days. Thursday night was fun. Everybody rolled into town, plus Tyra and Matt who are also living here in Hamburg, and then my roommate Lutz all piled into our kitchen and I whipped up some tacos for everyone. Good food, good fun, good drinks, and a great start to the weekend. We topped it all off with a couple drinks at Haus 73, and then went home to recharge for Friday.</p>

    <p>That next morning, I cooked a ton of scrambled eggs and we lazily got ready for something. Although we got a late start, we headed down to Vju, an old flak tower that was converted to a water storage bulding with solar panels all over it. We played around on a playground first, but then got up there and got a good view of the city, and jumped inside right as the downpour came. It's amazing how much Hamburg reminds me of Seattle.</p>

    <p>Despite the inopportune weather, we made the most of it. After our romp around Vju, I took the little ones on a ferry ride in the harbor, and then we went through the Altelbtunnel, under the Elbe to the other side of the harbor for a nice view of the city.</p>

    <p>We slowly and painstakingly got our tired bodies back home, made some food, and cuddled up to Frozen. Oh yeah. It was awesome. We popped some wine, and had a comfy start to our evening. Later on, my landlady and her friend joined us, and we were treated to some elderberry sorbet with champagne. Quite high society. The night was still young, so we hit the town. I took them to a bar that only has SOFAS!!! Comfy as all get out. Then we walked around the Reeperbahn (think Red Light District in Amsterdam), and then hit up Übel und Gefährlich (Evil and Dangerous), a club in another flak tower. We partied and danced til the wee hours of the morn.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/O4SbzI6h.jpg" alt="The Big Big Chair"></img>

    <p>Saturday Zack headed to Berlin to pick up his sister. Me, Colin, and Kat wandered around town. I showed them more of the Innenstadt, then we found this big giant red chair and plopped down for a bit, then we went to the Harbor and saw some boats and drank a Corona (Katherine took it drop by drop... Hahahah).</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SFETpEnh.jpg" alt="Kat and Colin"></img>

    <p>Unfortunately Katherine had to go home too, but Me and Colin met up with Derek, another PPPler, and headed out to Matt's Guest Family's Farm for their Easter Fire. Apparently fires are verboten in Germany, except on Easter. So every family lights up a small mountain of wood to celebrate. This was fun; fire accompanied with new people, food, and beer always makes for a good time.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hSFwXtZh.jpg" alt="A German Bonfire"></img>

    <p>Sunday was really lazy. Me and Colin laid around, grilled with my landlady (I made Bronco Burgers, but they still need some work), and then went to the park to throw some friz and chill. Another great day in Paradise.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/UWAoEGth.jpg" alt="Jalapeños in Deutschland"></img>

    <p>Overall, another great weekend.</p>

    <h2 id="NextUp">Next Up</h2>

    <p>A good weekend ahead of me coming up. Today after work, I'm grilling out with my landlady and some other people. BOOYAH for good weather.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow I'm playing a real game of Schlagball with my team against the other team in Hamburg. We're probably going to post up at the park afterwards and grill (BOOYAH). And who knows what else.</p>

    <p>On Sunday, Lutz and I are headed to a St. Pauli game!!! I'm so pumped!!!</p>

    <h2 id="Things">Things</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>I'm stressing about the future. Job searching is tough, and I'm trying to do it concurrently in Germany and the PNW. Not an easy task, especially considering the industry I want to get into, and the fact that I still don't have a strong idea of what I actually want to do.</li>
      <li>I think I am cursed with bad luck in one aspect of life that really bugs the hell out of me.</li>
      <li>Spring and Summer seem to be finally on their way! But the Seattle-likeness of Hamburg makes me feel just at home with the intermittent rain.</li>
      <li>I'm writing this at work because I have no motivation to write a report I've been working on for the last few weeks. Ugh.</li>
      <li>Life, WOOT!!!</li>
    </ol>
