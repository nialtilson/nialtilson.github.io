    <h1>A CRESCENDO TO THE START</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      I was told by my boss last week to "enjoy the rest of the summer". All 10
      days of it left...
    </p>

    <p>
      Things are slowly coming to a wrap for my time here in Washington. It is
      sad. I love Washington, the Pacific Northwest, and all the people and
      places that I call dear to me here. Not only that, but I have no idea
      when I will be returning here.
    </p>

    <p>
      As sad as that is to realize, I am doing my best to maintain my focus on
      what is to come. I will always have these people to connect with and
      reunite. Good friends never leave you, no matter how rare you see them or
      how far away you go. So regardless of what happens down the road, I will
      always have an amazing group of friends and family cheering me on, no
      matter where I go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quick post. BOOM.
