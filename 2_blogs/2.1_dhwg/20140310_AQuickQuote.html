    <h1>A QUICK QUOTE</h1>
    <br>

    <p>I'll probably go into it in more detail sometime down the road, but I've been getting really stressed out about what the hell I'm going to do after this program is done. It kinda feels like I'm slowly walking up to the edge of the cliff (aka the end of this program) and have no idea what lies down in the valley.</p>

    <p>I read <a class="body" href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/10580366/rashard-mendenhall-explains-decision-retire-nfl">an article today on ESPN</a> about how Rashard Mendenhall is retiring from the NFL. No, I'm no pro-football player with money saved up to do whatever the hell I want for years before I have to worry, but the last paragraph kinda rings true for me:</p>

    <p class="quote">"I do have a plan going forward, but I will admit that I do not know how things will totally shape out. That is the beauty of it! I look forward to chasing my desires and passions without restriction, and to sharing them with anyone who wants to come along with me! And I'll start with writing!"</p>

    <p>I need to work on my outlook. Yes, it's a little nerve-racking having no clue what is to come, but why am I worrying about it (student loans aside)? I've got the opportunity to do what I want, find something interesting, and go wherever that could take me? Why am I not excited for this?</p>

    <p>Despite the stress that will come, I'm going to work on changing my mentality over this. It's a complete fog, but I need to get excited and pumped for what could come down the road. Stress and worry gets you nowhere, but excitement does.</p>
