    <h1> A LOT GOING ON IN EVERY WAY </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      The last week and a half or so has been pretty jam-packed. Tons of things
      going on, tons of things to see, and somehow I haven't crashed from a
      lack of sleep or lack of energy.
    </p>

    <h2>Organs on the Inside</h2>

    <p>
      Last Tuesday I went to a Kölner Dom organ concert, the last one of the
      summer. They put it on for free every week in the summer for people to
      come and enjoy the beautiful music in such a beautiful, historic
      building. That was my first time in the Dom, and I was definitely amazed
      by the grandeur from the inside. That paired with the amazing music that
      we were able to enjoy, it was quite the treat. I took a video towards the
      end, but it can't quite capture the experience of being there. It was
      really something.

    <h2>After School Fun</h2>

    <p>
      Then the day after that, I took a little bike trip with my friend Zack.
      Once we got out of class, we jumped on the S-Bahn and went south for a
      while. Being the hardcore rebels that we are we got off one stop after
      our tickets were valid. I know, so hardcore.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the fun and exploration began. We wanted to get to the Rhein and
      head south, but first we ended up meandering our way through a series of
      single track, paved trails, and general nonsense that ended up being
      quite the beautiful ride on a sunny day. We rode along a small estuary
      down towards the Rhein and ended up taking a little ferry to get across.
      It was pretty awesome.
    </p>

    <p>
      We really hit a perfect day, it was hot, but absolutely gorgeous for a
      day ride. After we crossed the river, we made our way down to Bonn. Once
      there, we did some quality perusing and walked around Bonn's Innenstadt.
      Quite the quaint little city. A lot of beautiful things to see and it (at
      least when we were there) didn't give off the impression of a huge
      tourist trap, adding to the delightful feel.
    </p>

    <p class="quickhit">
      <strong>Sidenote:</strong>  I plan on using delightful a lot more because
      of its optimism and overall pleasantness.
    </p>

    <p>
      After walking around for a while, and indulging in some quality ice
      cream, we started making our way back up to Köln. A nice relaxed ride
      right around sun down really accentuated the quality day we were able to
      enjoy.
    </p>

    <h2>Roadtrip, Eurostyle</h2>

    <p>
      This past weekend, however, was an amazing experience that I hope can
      translate into endless adventure not only for the rest of the year, but
      for the rest of my life. Friday morning I skipped class with 3 other
      friends (Zack, Dawn, and Katherine, total rebels) and we hit the road. We
      rented a car, picked some cities and sights we wanted to see, and plowed
      ahead with a full tank of gas and homemade peanut butter and honey
      sandwiches. Shoutout to Dawnmom on that one fo sho.
    </p>

    <h3>Friday</h3>

    <p>
      From Köln, we made our way over to Aachen. There we walked around the
      inner city, checked out their Dom, some Roman ruins, and saw some other
      cool stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, we moved on to the Three Land Point (Dreilandpunkt). This is
      where Deutschland, Niederland, und Belgien meet, and is also the highest
      point in the Netherlands. This was really cool. Not too often can you say
      you've been in three different countries at the same time! When we were
      there, we went up in the tower at the point were able to see some amazing
      sights of all three countries. And of course, I got my souvenirs penny,
      but in Europe they use a 5¢ piece.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the Dreilandpunkt, we headed out to the coast of Belgium. At
      Knokke-Heist we had some fun on the beach. Despite the rain and grey
      skies, it was a beautiful day at the beach! Of course some shenanigans
      were had. What did you expect?
    </p>

    <p>
      From the English Channel, we made our way to Brugge. And what can I say,
      that is one beautiful city. Also not so packed with tourists, the
      atmosphere was amazing. We did a fair amount of walking around here and
      got to see a small portion of the beauty that city has. Before we left,
      we walked up and down the canal downtown and ended up going to a little
      restaurant for beer and mussels. Goddamn I love seafood, and these
      mussels were absolutely delicious!
    </p>

    <p>
      From Brugge to Brussels. We got into Brussels just after dark. And thanks
      to the navigation system in the car and Dawn's prior knowledge of French,
      we were able to find a place to stay. That was a huge relief and ended up
      being a very pain free process. We unloaded our chariot, got a little
      settled in, but then got ready and hit the town.
    </p>

    <p>
      First stop: Delirium. I think Dawn had heard of or been to this place
      beforehand, and apparently it was the bees knees. Turns out it is. It
      holds the world record for most commercially available beers for a single
      establishment at 2004. Yes, over 2000 beers in one place. Almost
      overwhelming, almost...
    </p>

    <p>
      We got there and I was pumped. First up was the Frolic Strawberry Lambic.
      Ho. Ly. Sh. It. It was easily in the top three best beers I've ever had
      the pleasure of enjoying. I was blown away. Ugh, if I could have a
      permanent tap of that in any residence I ever had, I don't know what I'd
      do with myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Knowing that would be impossible to top, I toyed with getting it again
      but decided against it and got one of deliriums home brews. Pretty good.
      Along with the delicious beer, we talked to some random people, and Zack
      hit the double whammy. Not only did he call someone's city boring right
      to there face, he got showed up by the bartender as he was trying to
      learn how to whistle with his fingers the loud way. Sorry Zack, but that
      was durn tootin funny. Then we ended up doing a little bit of night
      exploring in Brussels and saw the little peeing man. It was cool, and
      looked exactly as it sounds. Then, sleepy thyme.
    </p>

    <h3>Saturday</h3>

    <p>
      In the morning we did some more exploring of Brussels. We saw their
      version of the Arc D'Triomphe, stumbled upon a small air and space museum
      (ZOMFG I SAW AN F-16 IT WAS AMAZING HOLY COW!!!!!), and saw the European
      Parliament building (which had quite the astounding campus and
      structures). Next, off to faraway lands.
    </p>

    <p>
      So last summer, I went on probably my favorite trip to date with my boi
      Zach Tobin. When we were in Amsterdam, we stumbled upon this quaint
      bar/lounge called Langendijk, and I had an amazing beer from a brewery
      called La Chouffe. Turns out this brewery is located in Belgium, so guess
      where our next stop was...
    </p>

    <p>
      ...but wait, surprises abound! On our way to La Chouffe, we stumbled upon
      the European Space Center. I'd never even heard of the place, but we
      pulled in to see what they had going on. We were too cheap to pay the
      entrance fee, but we made the most of the playground and the exhibits
      outside of the building. Quite the cool random find!
    </p>

    <p>
      Next was La Chouffe and it made me happy. What a great place to share
      with friends, drinking good beer. It was quite a refresher, and I ended
      up getting a sampler pack, that came with a free glass. What what!?!
    </p>

    <p>
      From there, we went to Bastogne. Having Zack on the trip was quite an
      asset, not only due to his delightful nature, but his wealth of history
      knowledge. I never would've known half of the stuff we saw without his
      total enthusiasm for what has happened in the past.
    </p>

    <p>
      We went to Bastogne and visited an amazing memorial built by the Belgians
      to recognize and thank the USA for the work and support that we provided
      their country during WWII, namely the Battle of the Bulge. Very few
      things have made me truly proud to be an American and proud of what our
      country has done. But the words inscribed on this memorial showed the
      resilience of our country in the face of adversity, and the dedication we
      showed to ridding the world of evil for the good of all. It was truly a
      humbling place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Going through Bastogne, we stopped off and got some Belgian waffles.
      DAYUM they're good.
    </p>

    <p>
      My only beef with Belgium is that French people are kinda dicks. If you
      don't speak their language, they pretty much have no respect for you.
      That doesn't really make for a pleasant experience trying to get a taste
      of their land and people when all they have for you is disdain.
    </p>

    <p>
      From Bastogne, we went to Luxembourg. And all I can say, is I had no idea
      that Luxembourg would be such a beautiful place!  Luxembourg city is
      absolutely gorgeous. It sits on a canyon, and has part of the city on top
      of the canyon, and part of the city in the bottom of the canyon.
      Naturally, this makes for an absolutely wonderful and picturesque
      location. Not only was it quaint, it was gorgeous. I really want to go
      back here and really explore this city and country. Even though it is
      small, from what I saw, it really is quite a beautiful place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Saturday night we met up in Saarbrücken with some other PPPlers and had a
      helluva time. After getting in, we met up with Jenny, Mike, Kelsey, and
      Louisa, and got some drinks at a little bar, then we headed off to a
      wubstep party. Yes, wubstep is the same as dubstep. I just say wubstep
      because I think it sounds way cooler. But that was a blast, just dancing
      and going crazy and having a damn good time.
    </p>

    <h3>Sunday</h3>

    <p>
      We all stayed the night with PPPlers, and Sunday morning we had a big
      German breakfast with Jenny's host family. Holy cow are they delightful!
      So bubbly, excited, homely, and welcoming, they were extremely gracious
      to allow four random strangers into their home for such a wonderful
      morning!  And the food was delicious.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because we were so close, we made a pit stop in France.
    </p>

    <p>
      From Saarbrücken, we made our way to Trier. Home of Karl Marx's
      birthplace, and the oldest known gate in the world, Porta Nigra. That was
      fun, more walking around, more cool old buildings to see, oh, and another
      thing. Between Luxembourg and Trier, there was an 'Elephant Parade'. In
      both cities, there were a ton of painted elephant statues for an outdoor
      art exhibition to raise money for Asian Elephant preservation. They were
      pretty cool looking, my favorite one was in Luxembourg next to a church.
      It was the Fire Elephant, and it looked awesome. So that was cool seeing
      those in both cities.
    </p>

    <p>
      We got some wine and currywurst there before we headed off. Then we made
      our way to the Nürburgring!!!  I never thought I'd actually ever be
      there, but I was. And the place was huge!  We ended up going to the
      go-kart track and having some fun. Proud to say I tore it up. I
      absolutely love that kinda stuff, and so did everyone else. That was an
      absolute blast.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, we were making our way back to Köln, and randomly pulled off
      to a side road, and had an AMAZING sunset to send off our awesome
      weekend. That pretty much capped off such a beautiful trip in the perfect
      way. I couldn't help myself but just stare at the beautiful landscape
      that was in front of me. It's moments like that you wish would just last
      forever.
    </p>

    <p class="quickhit">
      <strong>Sidenote:</strong>  I officially broke my previous landspeed
      record. Last year with my boy Zach Tobin we hit 210 kmh. This trip I got
      up to 236 kmh. Which is about 142 mph. That was pretty exhilarating. And
      don't worry Mom, I was really safe, just ask everyone in the car. :-)
    </p>

    <h2>People Make the Difference</h2>

    <p>
      The trip was an absolutely amazing experience. And one of the reasons was
      the amazing people I was able to share it with. Dawn, Katherine, and Zack
      are great examples of truly genuine people and I am honored to have
      shared this trip with them. We had a ton of fun, and were able to really
      connect extremely well. As with most things in life, the people around
      you really make or break what's going on. This past weekend, they made it
      in every way.
    </p>

    <h2>Frisbee Update</h2>

    <p>
      Had practice last night for Frisbee, and this weekend I will be playing
      in the
      <a class="body" href="http://ultimate-dm2013.de/#/">Deutsche Meisterschaft im Ultimate</a>
      . Essentially the German Frisbee Club National tournament. WHA?!?!
      Thankfully last night I was able to practice the entire time without too
      many problems coming from my hamstrings. Not sure what was the trick, but
      I think it was either the massage I got beforehand form one of the
      players who is a physical therapist, or being bundled up like crazy
      trying to keep my legs really warm. Either way, I hope I can keep this
      good mojo going for the whole weekend!
