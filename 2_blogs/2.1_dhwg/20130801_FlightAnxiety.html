    <h1>FLIGHT ANXIETY</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      The whole depths of this program have started to set in. If nothing else,
      then at least the language part.
    </p>

    <h2>Big Differences</h2>

    <p>
      I have never really had a problem going off on my own. As a kid, I always
      sought independence. Most notably, I went off to a completely new
      city/state/school/side of the country where I had no knowledge of the
      location, the people, or anything at Ohio State. I didn't anticipate how
      hard it was going to be, I just went out. Holy hell yeah I had my tough
      spots, tons of stress, a lot of second guessing and regret of my
      decision, but I made it through. I left what and who I knew to go off on
      a new phase of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      This experience is pretty much like that, but to the extreme. I'm not
      only leaving what and who I know, I leaving how I know. A completely new
      country with a completely new language I have absolute minimal
      understanding of. I am essentially going I to this new country as a baby.
      Yes I've become a fully functioning adult in America, but now I have to
      learn how to do that in Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
      It really started setting in before we even took off from the plane. The
      Captain spoke in German over the intercom, all the stewards and
      stewardesses spoke German, the 'skymall' wasn't SkyMall but in German and
      in euros, the free magazine was in German, and this is just the start.
      Shortly all interaction with my surroundings will be in German, and I
      will be in a war of trial and error to get a grasp of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes I am excited for the language school, but it is for sure going to be
      a fairly slow learning process. I am going to be pushing myself and
      forcing myself to really get a good grip of this new language, new
      location, and at least for the next year (hopefully much longer) this new
      life.
