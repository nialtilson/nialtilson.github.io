    <h1> UGH </h1>
    <br>

    <p>All week I've been working on internship applications. And the only thing that's come out of it are a few of them being rejected. No interviews, no yea sounds great, just getting no's back. It's a little bit of a downer. On top of that, my nose is leaking like a sieve and completely useless for breathing.</p>

    <p>I've had a pretty good week though, all things considered. Frisbee, a mini tournament, a German Christmas Party, and some other stuff, have all added to the Christmas spirit, although I never really feel like Christmas is here.</p>

    <p>Anyways, I hope everyone out there is enjoying the seasons, staying warm and healthy, and enjoying the world around them!!!</p>
