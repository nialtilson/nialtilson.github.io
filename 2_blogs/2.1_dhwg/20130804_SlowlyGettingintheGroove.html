    <h1> SLOWLY GETTING IN THE GROOVE </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      It's day 3, and everyone can still tell I have no clue what I'm doing.
      Thankfully, everyone I've encountered thus far has had more patience than
      I could ever imagine.
    </p>

    <h2>First Test</h2>

    <p>
      Yesterday we had our language placement test for the language courses.
      They went ok. I got awarded with an A2 level. Just means I've still got a
      lot to learn (story of my life!  hahaha). We start the courses on Monday
      (tomorrow), so it's time to hit the ground running. I'm excited to get
      started, too, so I'll be learning more than just fumbling with words I
      don't know and verb tenses I've never seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the looks of it, the language school we're with, Carl Duisberg
      Centrum, is pretty dang good. The testers (at least the two that I had
      yesterday) were all very helpful, encouraging, and understanding as I
      tried to answer their questions as best as I could. I got placed in a
      class with two other CBYX/PPPlers (PPP = Parlementarisches Patenschafts
      Programm fur Junge Berufstätige) and a host of other people from all over
      the world. It is going to be a very unique experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Last night, I met up with some other PPPlers and we went to ein Bier
      Garten (YESSSSSSSSS). The essence of this culture and the thing I love
      most, chilling and drinking. It was great. Honestly, I have no idea why
      the beer garden subculture doesn't have strong roots in America. It's
      such a great way to stay connected with people and still enjoy yourself
      outdoors with alcohol. It can't be beat.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, I only have one complaint with Köln thus far. Kölsch is the beer
      brewed everywhere around here. Theres a ton of different types, some
      good, some bad. But no matter what kind, the serving sizes are small,
      usually no more than 0.3L. Where are my masses (big glasses)?  It turns
      out, the serving sizes are so small because you can't let this beer get
      warm, or else it'll just taste terrible. That's a good sign, huh. But
      either way, it's delicious, it's beer, and it flows like water here.
      (Literally, it's cheaper than water).
