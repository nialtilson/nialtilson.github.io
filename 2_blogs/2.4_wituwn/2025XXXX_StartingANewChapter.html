    <p>The chaos of the move came to a culmination on the day before the departure, as KLM cancelled my flight from Amsterdam to Portland. Cue the ensuing hours of annoyance dealing with customer service and trying to ensure that all of my bags made it with me. It all worked out, and after an extra 10 hours added to the overall trip, I landed in Portland, ready to start my new journey.</p>

    <h2 id="Welcome">Welcome Back, Asshole</h2>

    <p>I got off the plane and it surprisingly wasn't surreal at all, just kinda felt normal. PDX has gone through some major upgrades, so I wandered through the airport and was looking forward to seeing my Mommy as a perfect way to welcome me back. But lo and behold, Mommy was flanked by Ryan, Helen, and Callan to welcome me back to the USA! And no less with a nice sign to show their true affection for me as a person... I wouldn't have it any other way. :-)</p>

Apartment hunting, and the struggles of that

Biking back at Black Rock. Such a mecca, but stuck in winter still

Car hunt, and as with everything else, analysis paralysis

Work and what a joke, do they want me to work?

Food poisoning to round it all out
