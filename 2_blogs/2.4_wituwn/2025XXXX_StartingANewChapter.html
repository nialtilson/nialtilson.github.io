    <p>The chaos of the move came to a culmination on the day before the departure, as KLM cancelled my flight from Amsterdam to Portland. Cue the ensuing hours of annoyance dealing with customer service and trying to ensure that all of my bags made it with me. It all worked out, and after an extra 10 hours added to the overall trip, I landed in Portland, ready to start my new journey.</p>

    <h2 id="Welcome">Welcome Back, Asshole</h2>

    <p>I got off the plane and it surprisingly wasn't surreal at all, just kinda felt normal. PDX has gone through some major upgrades, so I wandered through the airport and was looking forward to seeing my Mommy as a perfect way to welcome me back. But lo and behold, Mommy was flanked by Ryan, Helen, and Callan to welcome me back to the USA! And no less with a nice sign to show their true affection for me as a person... I wouldn't have it any other way. :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="" alt="Welcome Back Asshole"></img>

    <p>That first weekend was spent with those four just getting my feet back on the ground and catching up. Getting my phone set up, picking up my incredible buddy Andy's old truck, getting some good food, talking about what's been going on, and adjusting in general. I've kinda always known this about myself, but I really struggle with accepting help from others. One of many many flaws that keep coming to the fore as I wander through my tough and weird journey of late.</p>

    <p>But Mommy ventured back north and Ryan, Helen, and Callan ventured back south, and soon enough I was off on my own. At least for a little while, before heading over to Andy and Megan's place to crash with them for a few days. No joke, I have an absolutely incredible group of people that I can call friends. Andy, Megan, and Mika invited me to stay with them for a few days to get my feet on the ground and what a blessing that was! I got tons of time to play and read with Mika, help Andy around the house a small bit, talk to Megan about school and stuff, and just enjoy their incredible company and unbelievable support.</p>

    <p>With my feet on the ground, wheels to move around town, and some temporary shelter provided by some amazing friends, it was time to try and get my life setup back in my new old hometown. Since my life has been in complete upheaval now for going on two months, I've been noticing the effects of that and this whole time trying to get my life reestablished is essentially a search for me to find solutions to my hierarchy of needs. Maslow's established what he sees as those points (see below for a quick refresher on that), but here are kinda the baselines of that for me...</p>

    <h2 id="Shelter">My Hierarchy of Needs - Shelter</h2>

    <p>As soon as that Monday hit though, my lovely hosts were off to work and school, and I hit the ground running looking for a place to live. I'd started the search intermittently in the weeks leading up to the flight back, but now that I was back with my boots on the ground, it was time to see what I could find.</p>

    <p>First try - scam. Place was clearly already lived in and I got ghosted. Second try - dingy as hell. Small, unkept, dirty, dark, definitely not a place to consider. Going on from there it was all a mixed bag. I had a sprinkling of viewings for almost the whole week, with a couple of applications sent out (one of which was a total scam and I got duped a large application fee). I learned quickly that trying to find a place to live in Portland is A) expensive, B) hard, C) shitty in the winter, D) difficult with some of the new relgulations, and I got hit with the brunt of all those points.</p>

    <p>By the end of the week I was still struggling with balancing what I wanted to compromise on, but had an application submitted for two different places in contention. One of which I had a bit of a time pressure to accept, as someone else was looking at the same place. And the other place I was first in the waiting list not thinking I'd be asked about it again. So long story short, I signed on to Place #1 (and two hours after signing the lease got a message about Place #2), and started to regret it immediately following signing the lease.</p>

    <p>Walking through and meeting the lady who ran the property company's operations was nice enough, and she was super helpful throughout the viewing process, but it was a clear thing that she was just there to make the owner money and get people in the apartments ASAP. On the second viewing I reassured some doubts and concerns about the place, and got to meet the maintenance guy while there, and he has shown he's a boisterous dude who really sucks at his job, and the move-in inspection of the place put that on full display.</p>

    <p>But bitching and moaning aside, I have a place to live! Check! It's actually quite bit, and has a massive basement I'll be turning into my little workshop. Shelter is taken care of. What's the next thing to figure out.</p>

    <h2 id="Stuff">My Hierarchy of Needs - Stuff</h2>

    <p>I've never claimed to be a minimalist, but my reliance on my stuff is likely a little more pronounced than your average person. Add to that fact that I'm now nearing two months without it and have an apartment that's quite empty waiting to be filled, this absence of stuff has been felt quite prominently.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, my shipping container has seen nothing but delays since it left my old place on the Sophienstrasse, and there's no telling when it will actually arrive. First a delay to get to Antwerp, then a delay of the boat leaving Antwerp, then a delay of the boat arriving in Norfolk, and now it's sitting in the port in Norfolk, VA, waiting to be put on a train to the West Coast. There's no telling when that'll happen, but it's been over a week now, and all I can do is twiddle my thumbs and hope to hear something soon.</p>

    <p>In the mean time, I'm trying to get the stuff I know I need that I don't already have somewhere, and that's been a rough process. Doesn't matter what it is, but people suck at responding. I've been leaning on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace (big ass bone to pick with that shitty company), but I'm at about a 95% rate of reaching out to people about whatever it is they're selling, and not getting any hint of a response. That's been frustrating as hell. Despite that all, I've secured a couch (that I'll likely be selling, it's uncomfy and I was impatient to get the ball rolling), and a bed (that's been nice, way better than sleeping on a camping pad). 


Apartment hunting, and the struggles of that

Biking back at Black Rock. Such a mecca, but stuck in winter still

Car hunt, and as with everything else, analysis paralysis

Work and what a joke, do they want me to work?

Food poisoning to round it all out
