    <h1>WEEK 1 IN PORTLAND</h1>
    <h2>Pre-Game</h2>

    <p>This one is gonna be a bit brief. I've still got to pack for Russia and get some other stuff done too, so I'm gonna get this thing out and then get prepped for my trip. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Home</h2>

    <p>After landing in Portland, I was super glad to be home. I got my car and headed straight back to see my good 'ole pal Dude. I walked in the house and there he was, just sitting at the top of the stairs.</p>

    <p>Well, he slowly came down the stairs and joined me outside as I unpacked all of my shtuff. He's old, but I love seeing him hang around outside. He was rolling around in the grass, showing some energy, and then just sitting there smelling the wonderful winter air blow on by. What a great dog and companion.</p>

    <p>As a fun little aside, I have a weird method of unpacking. When I get home after a trip, first, I dump all of my bags onto my bed and let all of my shit just sprawl out. Then, one by one, I put everything either back where it goes or in the hamper. It's a great way to go, because nothing gets lost in the fray. So, true to form, I dumped all the contents of all 6 bags onto my bed.</p>

    <p>But before I started putting things away, I went out and did some errands. Namely, I went to Costco to do some stuff and to surprise my mommy at work! After she clocked out, we went and grabbed a welcome home beer and nachos together. She's truly the best!!!</p>

    <p>After we got home I planned on putting all my stuff away. And it probably would've been a good idea too, considering it was all over my bed. But, I was way too tired to do anything, so I just pushed it all aside and passed out.</p>

    <h2>Dude, my buddy</h2>

    <p>That next morning, I was awoken by my mom. All she said was, "it's Dude." I knew something was wrong.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/8Fl2a0dh.jpg" alt="Dude - Stoic"></img>

    <p>I ran downstairs and he was laying in the bathroom. He tried to get up, but all he could really do was try. When he finally did, his whole body was shaking and he couldn't go far. It was clear that he was unable to keep going. Holy shit that was a hard day.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/QzHs4Llh.jpg" alt="Dude - Sticks"></img>

    <p>We had to take him to the vet and put him down that afternoon. That was easily one of the hardest, most emotion, and sad things I've ever had to do. He was such an amazing dog for all 12 years he was with our family. Full of energy, a zeal for everyone's food, an extreme hatred for large sticks, love for his partner in crime ZoÃ«, and a firm spot in our family.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Z7J3nhRh.jpg" alt="Dude and Zoe"></img>

    <p>What made it even harder was just how it happened. I don't know if I believe it, but both my mom and sister said that he waited for me to get back. He was so lively and happy the day I got back, but then struggling so hard that next morning. Throughout the day, despite his clear inability, he was still happy and smiling for us, trying to comfort us through the pain.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/gaZeLwah.jpg" alt="Dude - Hiding Out"></img>

    <p>As I said, it was dreadfully painful to go through, and it's really really weird being in the house and not having him around, but goddamnit he was an amazing dog. Dude, we miss you a ton here. Thank you for being a part of the family, and I can't wait to see you again.</p>

    <h2>Health Boy</h2>

    <p>Being in town, of course I had to go to a ton of doctors appointments. What other fun things could I expect to do!? Well, long story short, I'm a health boy! Yay!</p>

    <p>Well, other than my tight achilles and calves... I had a PT appointment and both of those guys are super tight. Remedy? Stretching. Lots of it. I need some accountability though, I get lazy with it sometimes. So don't hesitate to razz me and make sure I'm stretching!</p>

    <h2>Hypocrisy in Health</h2>

    <p>The hypocrisy in the US health industry is absolutely appalling. They promote health, but the whales majority (no pun intended) of people in it (at least in doctors offices I visit) are extremely overweight if not flat out obese themselves. At all of the doctors appointments I had, I could count on one hand the amount of nurses and assistants that I saw that did not look unhealthy.</p>

    <h2>My Slice of Americana</h2>

    <p>With all of the doctors appointments and stuff, I got a good taste of some deliciousness. After running some errands, I went and chowed down on a #9 with extra peppers from Jimmy Johns. Omnomnomnomnomnom. That next morning, I went to a little breakfast place in Oregon City and was blown away by some cheesy bacon eggs benedict with hashbrowns and a side biscuit with gravy. Ohhhhhh BOY. Omnoms like woah.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/8McWo6Rh.jpg" alt="Eggs Benny and Hash"></img>

    <p>And then on Saturday morning before my mom and I got a ton of errands done, we headed to The Hazel Room on Hawthorne for some further deliciousness. I got the Tallboy, a biscuit sammich with meat like woah. And, as part of the Tallboy, you get a free Olympia Tallboy. Hot DAMN it was delicious, especially with a nice bloody mary on the side. FOOOOOOOD LIKE WOAAAAAAAH.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/epXMgcih.jpg" alt="The Tallboy"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vdnPJPgh.jpg" alt="The Tallboy"></img>

    <p>I will love food forever and ever. Especially when I can chow down on some delicious stuff like this.</p>

    <h2>Camera Stuff</h2>

    <p>The day after I got back, I took it into a local repair shop to get it (hopefully fixed). I picked it up on Saturday, and I'm really hoping it's good to go this time. If not, bwuh. I don't even know.</p>

    <h2>Personal Christmas</h2>

    <p>Being back in the US, I definitely took advantage of some shopping opportunities and some borderline needs of mine. A new backpack, a Kindle, a new camera tripod, and a bunch of other stuff. I'll count it all off as preparation for my move to Germany, but damnit, it's Christmas time. Time to TREAT YO SELF. So thanks REI, you are awesome.</p>

    <h2>Mommy Time</h2>

    <p>Earlier I mentioned that my mom is the best. Well, it is the truth. No discussion. Over the week that I've been home, we've spent a lot of time just hanging out, talking, and getting things done together.</p>

    <p>I love my mom, and the fact that we've grown together and are on excellent terms compared to the middle of high school. She's so supportive of what I do and proud of who I've become. And she should be, because she contributed a helluva lot to get me to where I am today.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bcn72gXh.jpg" alt="Christmas with Mom and The Pack"></img>

    <p>Some of the fun things we've done this week include polishing off a bottle of wine with some bacon mac and cheese, watching Elf, watching Inside Out (twice), staying in on Sunday and doing nothing but watching football, getting our Christmas tree cut and put on the car in all of 10 minutes, sharing a DEEEElicious breakfast at The Hazel Room, and just being able to hang out and catch up.</p>

    <p>Mom. You kick ass. Thank you for being who you are and supporting not just me, but Peewee, Ali, and Aaron too. I love you so much!!!!!!</p>

    <h2>Crazy KC Sighting</h2>

    <p>Rather than be a home-body the whole time I was home, my good 'ole pal KC hit me up and invited me out to join him and his dance partner at a local bar for some swing dancing. I debated not going, but am so glad that I did!!!</p>

    <p>KC is a cool dude, and it was great catching up with him and hearing how he's been doing here in Portland. What a badass making some plays in the world.</p>

    <p>In addition to seeing my buddy, the night was AWESOME!!! The dancing part was not my forte and in fact quite intimidating, but the music was absolutely awesome. Some great stuff (the High Water Jazz Band and Jacob Miller and the Bridge City Crooners for all those reading at home). And I snagged a date out of it with this cool girl I somehow met and danced with.</p>

    <p>So absolutely awesome on all accounts.</p>

    <h2>Alex and Alisha at Home</h2>

    <p>As brief as my time here this week has been, I was also able to meet up with Alex and Alisha and check out their new house! What a delight to see them in such a cozy new place! We chatted it up, talked about Japan and travels and such, and then enjoyed some delicious dinner with them as well as some fresh christmas cookies. They're awesome, and I'm so glad I can call them friends!</p>

    <h2>Struggles of Being Away</h2>

    <p>One of the hardest things about being gone so much is missing out on all of what goes on with the people I know and love here back home. Not only am I weak on contact when I'm gone, but I miss out on all the fun stuff people get into here. I know it's a big tradeoff, and don't get me wrong, I am extremely blessed and thankful to be doing what I'm doing at this point in my life, but it is hard. As someone who wants to do everything, I wish I could have the best of both worlds. But I'll be back in August and then I'll have a bit of a new normal. I just need to focus on enjoying every opportunity that passes through my door, be it a trip to a new country, or a few hours catching up with some great friends.</p>

    <h2>Up Next</h2>

    <p>Well, tomorrow I begin my trip to Russia with Zack. It hasn't hit me yet, and it probably won't until we fly into Moscow. But I'm really excited to see what we'll get to experience while we're there. It's going to be butt cold, and I think I've got enough cold-weather gear. If not, I'll have to get something over there.</p>

    <p>But yeah. Russia, here we come!!!</p>
