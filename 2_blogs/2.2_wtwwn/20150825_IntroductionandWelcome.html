    <h1>INTRODUCTION AND WELCOME</h1>
    <br>

    <p>Welcome, one and all, to this new blog thingy I'm starting.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/mZKvmGih.jpg" alt="Welcome, One and All!"></img>

    <p>It's been over a year since the beloved CBYX program ended. It was an unbelievably impactful time of my life, and I'm unbelievably grateful for all that I was able to do, see, and learn through my year in Germany.</p>

    <p>Exchange programs, however, aren't the only time of life where you learn something, interact with something new, or get slammed into the front seat of the struggle bus trying to get by in a completely foreign environment. So in the spirit of constant learning and reflection, either in a new world or right outside my back door, I'm going to start up a new blog, Wandering the World with Nial.</p>

    <p>This won't be limited to travel, but every new or old thing that comes my way. I've learned that I'm best at reflecting through either interaction and processing with other people, or writing things down to clarify my thoughts. For those times that I don't have a listening ear immediately available, I'll be coming live to all you guys out there through this. </p>

    <p>Life is a constant, crazy, and unpredictable journey, and I look forward to having you along for the ride!!!</p>
