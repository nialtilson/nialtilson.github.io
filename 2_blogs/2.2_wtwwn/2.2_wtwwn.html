    <h1>WANDERING THE WORLD WITH NIAL</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      After having my life completely altered from my CBYX/PPP Year in Germany, the desire to see and experience the world never left my side. I may have had to move away from Germany after not finding a job, but that wasn't the end of it. No siree.
    </p>

    <p>
      After two unsuccessful months of trying to find a job, I packed up and moved back to the US, to a new place where I would eventually feel completely at home, for this first time in years. Home would be somewhat of a fluid term though, as after a long search, I found a job that would send me back all around the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      This blog chronicles this period of my life and others, as I move on from feeling like a freshly-graduated college student and a ripe new world traveler, to an 'adult' with less of a clueless mindset about what's going on in the world, and a continual hunger to see and do all that can be found.
