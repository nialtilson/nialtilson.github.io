    <h1> BLOGS </h1>

    <p>
      It all started way back when, in the fateful year 2013. I was a fresh
      college grad with barely an idea of the world getting ready to move to a
      foreign country for a year. I had no idea it was going to completely
      change my life, but that's exactly what it did.
    </p>

    <p>
      How is that relevant for blogs? Well, that year was when I decided to
      start documenting (publicly) what the hell is going on from my life. The
      main reason was to let my family back home know what was going on with me
      halfway across the world. From there, it's developed into a way for me to
      keep track of what I've done, reflect on what I've seen and learned, and
      help me realize how lucky of a human being I just am.
    </p>

    <p>
      That blog has transformed slightly as I've jumped to a few different
      phases in my life since then.
    </p>

    <small>
      As of the rough date of getting this website up and running, all the
      blogs that were previously hosted on blogspot were all cut and pasted to
      this new spot.
