    <p>This trip had been on my mind for quite a while. Last summer, this was the main thing I wanted to do, but with COVID raging through Europe and borders still closed, that just wasn't an option.</p>

    <p>Keeping an eye on the news while I was home, I saw at the start of August that Scotland and the UK changed up their travel requirements - if you were vaccinated you no longer needed to quarantine for 14 days. BOOM BABY!!! I was in business!!! As soon as I figured that out, I knew my plans were on and I had a nice little adventure to look forward to.</p>

    <p>A Road Trip through Scotland with three goals:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mountain Biking</li>
      <li>Backpacking and Hiking</li>
      <li>Whiskey Drinking</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All I wanted to do, and hot-diggity-damn was I in for a treat!!!</p>

    <h2 id="TurbulentTurnaround">A Turbulent Turnaround</h2>

    <p>After landing in Stuttgart, returning from my wonderful trip back home, I was ready to hit the ground running and head straight off to my next adventure! The plan was to land, pick up some bike parts, do laundry that night, pack the car, and the next day head out on the road with Rupert, my bike, and three weeks of adventuring in Scotland! Welp, Delta and KLM sure had something to say about that.</p>

    <p>Getting to baggage claim I waited, waited, and waited some more, until the turnstile stopped and neither of my bags showed up. Quite the unique little wrench the universe handed me. I was ready to just sit there and wait until the next plane came with (hopefully) my bags, but got in touch with KLM and hit the road.</p>

    <p>First stop was in TÃ¼bingen to pick up my bike parts. As soon as I got home, I set to getting my Patrol back up and running. At least I could get that squared away and ready for the trip. But for the rest of it, I kinda needed my biking, hiking, and adventuring gear. And since my biking, hiking, and adventuring gear were in two suitcases somewhere in the hands of KLM, I was kinda put on ice.</p>

    <p>Thanks to jet-lag, I had a bit of an early night. I be-bopped around the house to get a few things done, take care of a couple small tasks, but since I couldn't do laundry to really get things done, I called it a day.</p>

    <p>That next day, I was itching to get going, but KLM was nothing but slow to the punch. Well, long story short, the minute I left the house in the afternoon to go run and get something, that was the exact minute the guy showed up with the suitcases. Thankfully though, they arrived intact and now the real trip prep began!</p>

    <p>I briefly toyed with trying to get everything done and leave that night, but opted for the more relaxed route (I was on vacation dammit!) and had that night to get prepped and ready to go. Laundry at the laundromat, groceries and snacks from Kaufland, and slowly but surely figuring out all that I needed to bring with me for the adventures at hand.</p>

    <p>Along with that trip prep, I did the logistical trip prep of figuring out what the actual limitations/rules were for entry. Although I was vaccinated, I still had to do a PCR test within two days of arrival, so I did my best to figure where in the hell that was possible. Eventually I got all the logistics squared away, including booking my train ticket the next day, my bags were packed, and I was ready for one helluvan adventure!!!</p>

    <h2 id="OffWeGo">Off We GOOO!!!</h2>

    <a class="body_ctr" href="https://www.polarsteps.com/NialTilson/4256404-scotland?s=FEBA20E7-4C37-4DEB-9BF5-18DAD2CE6FC5">Spark Notes - My Polarsteps Journey</a>

    <p>After a good night's rest, it was time to load up and GTFO. I made a nice breakfast, packed all my snacks, got all my stuff in the car, and then Rupert and I were ready to go!!!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/01wJYJGh.jpg" alt="Rupert packed and Ready"></img>

    <p>The most direct route to Calais was through France, but France has some pretty high tolls which I wasn't looking to pay. Thankfully, the route through Luxembourg and Belgium dropped me right into the Northeast corner of France to skipp all the tolls. Hot damn!</p>

    <p>The early start got me out on the road on a grey, cloudy, and rainy day. I had a train departure on the Chunnel (!!!) all set, and a PCR test reserved shortly after I was set to arrive in Great Britain. Although it was a bit flexible, I had a goal and timeline to hit for the ~7 hour drive. So I jumped in the car, turned on <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantaram_(novel)">Shantaram</a> audio book (thanks for the recommendation Dawn!), and I was off!</p>

    <p>I had on-and-off rain teh whole way. But with fairly empty roads, the drive kept rolling along fairly easily. I had soon enough passed through Luxembourg, then Belgium, and after filling up on gas, air, and a snack break, I was headed into France! From the border it was just a short hop, skip, and a jump down the highway, and I was pulling up the Chunnel (aka Eurotunnel, its official name)!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0IYNdUOh.jpg" alt="Rainy Roadway"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7PKVJzxh.jpg" alt="Entering Luxembourg"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fhed65ih.jpg" alt="Entering Belgium"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/V3rEjlah.jpg" alt="Entering the Chunnel!"></img>

    <p>It being such a revolutionary bit of infrastructure the world over, I was extremely stoked to get the chance to experience the Chunnel! Yes, it's officially called the Eurotunnel, but that name is boring and too stiff. My time was booked for a ride across the channel, but I actually arrived a little early and got a spot on the earlier train. Lovin it!</p>

    <p>As i rolled in an d checked in, I had just enough time to run into the giant welcome center, use the facilities, snag a power adapter, and then my group was being called into line. And with that, it was time to get going!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/oJFZUNjh.jpg" alt="Rupert Resting before the Chunnel"></img>

    <p>Well, if I'd have taken my trip a year or two before, i have a feeling the whole process would've been a little less complicated. But with that ridiculous thing known as Brexit, things are a bit different. So as I jumped into the line to get loaded on, I had a bit of a process to get through.</p>

    <p>From the giant parking lot at the welcoming center, once you see your train/group/number on your ticket on the giant board, you hope in your car and join the line (<em>queue</em>). At first you kinda curve around, and then someone verifies you can enter the giant fenced off where things get real.</p>

    <p>The two lines of cars opened up to about 10 lanes, and first step was the French Customs checkpoint. Easy enough, quick chat with the guy, then pulled off to the next stop. British Customs checkpoint, also simple enough. This time surprised with some English, but made it through that. All along the way were bunches of sensors and xray things, but the funnel of checkpoints and such was complete, and then I got funneled through to the actual waiting area. Kinda like a ferry, I just had to sit and wait.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/d42klFEh.jpg" alt="Tiny Roundabout"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/6eAMsWeh.jpg" alt="UK Border Checkpoint"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/WaNFPCzh.jpg" alt="Lots of Waiting"></img>

    <p>After a good 10-20 minutes of standing around in the hazy sunlight, looking at the gigantic complex and all the stuff going on, my line of cars was on the move - time to load up! The waiting area was right next to the train tracks, so after getting on the move, we were led onto a big bridge that spanned the (what seemed like 20) train tracks in the area. But the bridge had ramps that led down to the gaps in between each track, and our group was shuttled down one of those. Once we came to track level, there was an open train car waiting for us, and in we go!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BJxIxxVh.jpg" alt="Gate onto the Bridge"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0RczQsAh.jpg" alt="Train Area"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/rnA5neth.jpg" alt="S-Curve into the Cars"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/8ILxWHIh.jpg" alt="The Belly of the Beast"></img>

    <p>Once onto the train car, we were all ushered forward until we were either butt-up against the car in front of us, or at the start of a new train car. For me, I got the start of the new car bit, and once I parked, it was a matter of waiting until we got going. That sign came once the doors between the train cars got shut. We were on our way! (Can you tell I was pretty excited for this whole thing!?)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bDj5p2Bh.jpg" alt="Start the Doors"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hQB8TCDh.jpg" alt="View Forward..."></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hQB8TCDh.jpg" alt="...is Closing"></img>

    <p>Parked, train doors shut, and just kinda waiting, I didn't even realize once the train started moving! Made sense, because all I had to look out of from the car was the giant monolithic train car, with only a tiny little porthole within view to the outside world.</p>

    <p>The ride was actually quite smooth. But since I didn't have anything to look at (and wouldn't have even if there were bigger windows, we were going through a tunnel under the sea by the way...), I decided a nap was in store. We were only supposed to need about 35 minutes to cross the channel, so that was some perfect timing if you ask me.</p>

    <p>Naps, always the right answer. After I woke up, I still had a little time until the trip would come to completion. As I was heading into a foreign land and foreign world, where the driving would be something different than I know, I took after some recommendations and put myself some reminders together to help keep me on track on the wrong side of the road.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VA9aArmh.jpg" alt="Drive on the LEFT"></img>

    <p>All of a sudden, there was light coming out of the porthole, I was officially on Britsh soil! Quite a pretty cool, and altogether quick and seamless, way of getting there! We stopped, the doors between the train cars opened up, and after a bit of waiting, we were let loose and let the games begin!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/P86IWTPh.jpg" alt="Porthole to British Soil"></img><br>

    	<source src="https://i.imgur.com/t8fLkxu.mp4"  type="video/mp4">
    </video>

    <p>As soon as I was out and back in daylight and on dry pavement, I snapped into gear. As I said, I was now driving with left-hand traffic, and it was an immediate entrance to a different world. Mental reminders to constantly stay to the left started, I maneuvered out of the giant complex, and I was jumping on the highway (<em>motorway</em>) to start heading north. Off we go!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bGjJJ9vh.jpg" alt="Left-Hand Traffic"></img>

    <h2 id="Day1-Drive">Heading North</h2>

    <p>After I was unleashed onto British Soil, as I said, I had a PCR Test to take. On the way, I pulled off a Motorway rest stop to fill up on gas (shit's expensive yo), and popped in to use the bathroom (<em>loo</em>), and had my first kinda shock/surprise. Ritter Sport is a German chocolate, something I get fairly regularly. But seeing the Rum Traube Nuss version in English was a very vivid double take for me - I was in a foreign place.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ArzixABh.jpg" alt="Rum Raisin Hazelnut"></img>

    <p>My PCR appointment had me take a B-line over towards Gatwick Airport (south of London). Google Maps took that pretty literally and had me take some country roads to get there. Normally I'm not a fan of that, as I'd rather take the fast roads to get there, but this was a delightful little detour that led to something fun.</p>

    <p>As I learned very quickly, which held throughout Britain and Scotland, once you get off the motorway, streets can get really thin. Hedges, fences, parked cars, there's not a lot of space to squeeze your car over the road. But, despite the toothpick wide lanes (honestly, not too much different than the tight alleyways in Germany, but just an adjustment for me being on the wrong side of the road), I cruised past the various countryside accoutrement of the UK. Oh Look!!! A Double Decker Bus!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Isi5hHLh.jpg" alt="Double Decker Delivery"></img>

    <p>Once I got to the parking lot-turned test center, I had a fairly easy time of it. Got in, checked in, stayed in my car as they probed my nose, and in the blink of an eye I was finally set free to start my first big trip in a year. But first I had to get out of the place. It's hard to enter the code at the gate when the display is on the right side of the vehicle, and I'm on the left...</p>

    <p>But thankfully someone was right out in front of me, and I was able to sneak behind them and get out. Now, finally off and running, I decided to double back along the country roads I'd taken on the way in to go see something that piqued my interest.</p>

    <p>After thinking I took a wrong turn and pulling into the wrong side of the parking lot entrance (oops!), I reoriented and got myself on the correct direction. Shortly thereafter I found myself at a little clubhouse with a sprawling semi-kept lawn. Time to watch some cricket! :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lI9GwXPh.jpg" alt="Cricket Pitch"></img>

    <p>I don't know how I got turned on to cricket, but I'm a huge fan of it. Never been to a game, still don't know all the rules in-depth, but I have always been fascinated by the sport.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">To be honest, I find cricket more of a sport than baseball...</p>

    <p>I pullled up and put my 'dinner' together and was able to find a bench next to the pitch to post up and watch. What a perfect little way to go! A cozy bench, some local folks practicing some cricket, and a relaxing evening to get my first taste of British culture.</p>

    <p>It seemed to me that this was a local clubhouse (likely similar to the German Verein setup), with a bunch of folks out for some practice on a Friday night. There were some folks by the clubhouse with some drinks, there was a little scoreboard over there, and it looked like I stumbled upon a little slice of life in the neighborhood. How delightful!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7OtyQNYh.jpg" alt="Winding Up"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/rkbCFCah.jpg" alt="Release"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/NOJc1Rth.jpg" alt="Hit"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ji2bBtdh.jpg" alt="The Union Jack"></img>

    <p>Relaxing, delicious, somewhat-insightful, low-key, and overall enjoyable. Really glad my eyes werw scanning on the drive to the test center, and LOVE the inherent flexibility of solo-adventuring. The practice didn't last all too long, but I was able to sit, eat, and watch a little bit of such an intriguing sport.</p>

    <div class="quickhit">
      <p>As I was sitting there, I realized how much I've been able to enjoy Sports connected to the cultures of the various places I've traveled. I'm a huge fan of traveling, and sports, and being able to combine and experience them both has been an insightful blast around every turn. To kinda recap, here's what I mean here:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sumo Wrestling in Japan</li>
        <li>Baseball in Cuba</li>
        <li>Hockey in Russia</li>
        <li>Soccer/FuÃball in Germany</li>
      </ul>

      <p>That's a pretty cool list, but a few others are still in my head that I'm looking to experience at some point in my life. Cricket in India or a number of other countries (would love to go to a full-day test with a crew of fun folks), Rugby in New Zealand (bummed I wasn't able to do that when I was there a couple years ago), and a couple more yet to come!</p>
    </div>

    <p>After their practice wrapped up, it was time for me to hit the road. At that point, I still had about a 6-7 hour drive to get to the border of Scotland. Since it was late in the day, and I wasn't feeling like pushing it, I knew I wasn't going to get it all that night. Despite that, I hit the road and knew I could get a couple more hours out of the way before knocking off for the night.</p>

    <p>With my audio book keeping me going, I used the trip to get more and more used to driving on the wrong side of the road. The day slowly crept forward towards a beautiful sunset over the road. With the sun down, I kept pushing a bit further, but ended up looking for parks or some potential places where I could park in relative peace for the night.</p>

    <p>That search put me onto a park right next to the motorway with a decent looking parking lot, so I re-routed and headed towards some sleep. Got off the highway, headed through a town and took a right, and then right before the park I saw what looked like a little pub. Being in Britain, pub culture being a big thing, knowing I was on an adventure, I knew I had to stop in for a little night cap.</p>

    2021.08.29
    	â¢ Waking up, didnât want to.
    	â¢ Rolled around for longer than I thought, nice!
    	â¢ Got in gear, repacked, and hit the road
    	â¢ (See Polarsteps)
    	â¢ Beautiful morning with blue skies and sunshine
    	â¢ Once I got near the Lakes district though, landscape and weather changed
    	â¢ Shit tons of sheep and stone fences all over the place. Felt like the UK because of that.
    	â¢ Soon enough I was in Scotland!!!
    	â¢ Stopped by Starbucks for coffe and to refill water. Folks were super friendly
    	â¢ Needed something to eat, found Patâs Pantry on the way to Ae
    	â¢ Rolled up and it was a nursery. Wasnât sure what was what, but went in and found the delightful little cafÃ© in the back with a patio overlooking the countryside. Gorgeous!
    	â¢ Got some pancakes, did some research, then was off to go ride!!!
    	â¢ Easy getting over to the trailhead
    	â¢ Found a spot, got a Milky Way at the cafÃ© (!) next to the bike shop (!!) to get change to pay for parking
    	â¢ After getting changed and nearly being on the way, I noticed a really annoying grinding sound on my rear brakes. No dice
    	â¢ Went back, adjusted the caliper location, pulled out the pads, pressed in the pistons, and after that it was good to go
    	â¢ Up we go! Kinda. Not super straightforward where to go, but took the first forest road and we were on the way. After a while, got to the top top and took a minute to enjoy the views
    	â¢ Down we go. Got in a few runs of the orange lines. A couple features that I rolled around, but otherwise quite tame.
    	â¢ Pushed up another then went down. Rocky but fun
    	â¢ After a while, realized how a lot of the trails were really short. Then after some riding, realized that the fact that there were downhill trails was a bit of an exception in the southwest highlands at leastâ¦ Most places have Tours mapped out, longer XC routes. Not the kinda riding Iâm all about. But might have to get into for a bit.
    	â¢ Got some riding in, had a few chats with some other riders, then after one more run down shredder and omega man, decided to call it a day. An ok first ride in Scotland
    	â¢ Back at the car, the lots were pretty empty. Lazily put all my bike stuff away, changed, filled up on water, than did some research leaching off the cafÃ© wifi. Noice
    	â¢ Then nap time. Oh yeah. From there, to Dumfries to cruise through town and find somewhere to eat
    	â¢ Headed into town and ate at Crumb. Looked good and had a good rating on google
    	â¢ Got in, seated, and got me a glenkinchie 12yr to go with the sea bass
    	â¢ Holy shit the sea bass was delicious. Lemony taste off the grill. Fantastic, and even came with some shrimp. Fucking goodâ¦
    	â¢ After dinner back to the car and unsure what to do. Decided to grab the camera and head off on a walk through the center of Dumfries.
    	â¢ Delightful, but weird with how quiet and empty it was. Sunday night, but still
    	â¢ Made a nice loop, got a good vibe of the buildings and such, then after a walk along the water, jumped in the car and off to find a place to sleep
    	â¢ Cool thing about Scotland is the prevalence of little parking spots (think mini rest stops) along highways
    	â¢ Google mapped a spot I could probably park and sleep, but along the way was a choice mini rest stop, so parked, reshuffled Rupert; then hit the sack!


    2021.08.30
    	â¢ Slept. A ton. Didnât realize I could get about 12 hours in Rupert. Rolled around more than I though but liked it.
    	â¢ Lazy up and at em. Apple with pbj and croissant
    	â¢ Audibled and nixed the idea of Mabie forest riding. Looked to be just a small jump line, and I doubted the quality of such based on the day before
    	â¢ With that, off to go see a castle!!!
    	â¢ Parked early cause I didnât know if I could clear the archway, but walked on down to Caerlaverock Castle
    	â¢ Pretty unique shape, triangular, and the red brick was covered all over with algae, moss, and lichen
    	â¢ Bummer, but the inside was closed due to danger of falling rock. Damn
    	â¢ Walked around the moat, and pretty diol, because they had a QR code that gave you a 3D model of the castle to follow along, and some of the signs on the inside were on there to read! How cool!
    	â¢ Was sitting down on the grass trying to read a sign on the model and a lady behind me asked me to move. Got really irked by this. All she had to do was take a couple steps to the side in either direction to get me out of view (kinda how field of view works), but insisted on standing there and making me move. Pissed me off more than it shouldâve but obliged despite my frustration
    	â¢ Walked around, quite a cool building. Unique with the shape, and weird to see how open the back half was
    	â¢ Went and read a sign next to the Bildung, and that castle was the ânewâ castle, with the old castle a little walk through the woods away
    	â¢ Then went and walked down to the old castle, or the floor plan thereof that was excavated/exposed
    	â¢ Kinda crazy to see how small it was ito size. Couldnât imagine any biggiah gatherings there
    	â¢ A little more walking, to the bench to sit and watch the new castle and people, and then off!
    	â¢ Got some gas on the way to Dalbeattie. Parked and got ready to ride
    	â¢ This place was selected because of The Slab, a feature the dude at Ae talked up. Stoked to go check it out and at the prospect of some more downhill focused trails, at least per what I saw on the Trailforks map
    	â¢ Got in, checked out one black (not a black), then up to the red for the lookout (was no lookout), then off to the slab
    	â¢ A lot amaller than I imagined, but still a giant ramp of rock
    	â¢ Got a couple runs in, definitely a good bit of fun
    	â¢ Off to the spot I thought was some single track
    	â¢ Had to hunt to find the up trail, eventually found it
    	â¢ Got up and the trails were a bit jumbled or my goâs was off
    	â¢ In all, did. The only two trails there that I saw existed, and they were some good, raw, techy fun. Short, but pretty awesome
    	â¢ Emphasis on the short though, because I was feeling like I ran out of decent options at that point.
    	â¢ Hit a few rocky lines on the ride out, but off to the parking lot
    	â¢ Googled it, because those two spots were recommended and didnât end up with much, and found a couple other places that look more appetizing for riding to check out towards the end of the trip
    	â¢ Changed and bummed around in the parking lot for a bit planning my next move, the off to dinner
    	â¢ The Harbour Inn in Garlieston. Tiny spot, hole in the wall, packed to the gills inside, so sat outside
    	â¢ Good chicken and chili (aka sweet and sour chicken) and the cask golden ale was decent too
    	â¢ Then off to my campsite a half hour away. Late check in, but got my tent popped up next to Rupert, went and read by the water, then off to bed
    	â¢ Been listening to Shantaram while driving and itâs really enveloping. Great book, but itâs taking my mind off the countryside a ton
    	â¢ Beautiful countryside though. So many goddamn sheep, and some cows sprinkled in

    2021.08.31
    	â¢ Easy wake up. Shoulder/left back is still killing me
    	â¢ Packed everything away and had breakfast
    	â¢ I donât think this is why I like mountains more than sea/ocean, but ocean vistas are so broad, itâs hard to capture it all in a picture. Mountains are the same, but there is height to it, elevation, something for the up and down. Oceans and beaches and the like is primarily side to side
    	â¢ Went for a walk along the beach before heading out. Trail mirrored the road for a while, then I jutted out onto a natural jetty to get a little closer to the water
    	â¢ Long jetty, didnât make it all the way. Kinda was done with it, and the stench of exposed algae and barnacles and such was something I hadnât smelt in a while. Whewâ¦
    	â¢ Sauntered back to the car and I was off!
    	â¢ More Shantaram on the way. Probably because of my personality, but I feel like audiobooks might be too much of a distraction or attention puller for me, really focusing on the book and story, rather than taking in the countryside
    	â¢ Made my way over through essentially a jungle road over to Bruceâs Stone
    	â¢ Cool stone on a pretty overlook from Loch Trool, commemorate the start of the war for Scottish independence from Robert the Bruce
    	â¢ Toyed with the idea of a hike up the Merrick for the view but wasnât feeling motivated. The idea of the hike around the lake was shorter, but wasnât inspired about that either. Iâm trying to figure out what I wanted to do next, got a little disappointed and just took a nap
    	â¢ Woke up, and hit the road. No maps this time, just time to drive. Direction Glasgow
    	â¢ Beautiful drive, stopped a few times for pictures before getting into Girvan
    	â¢ Before getting fully into town, pulled over and parked at the park before taking a nice long walk around town. Getting sights of Ailsa Craig, some first farmers pulling their nets out onto a truck, got some soft serve (not the biggest fan of soft serve, but it was sugary and I was hungry), and did some overall moseying around town. Nice little loop
    	â¢ Essentially three days in Scotland already, and have yet to see my full shadow. Only a couple of times have I so far seen an inkling of it, and it disappeared shortly thereafter
    	â¢ From Girvan I was headed toward Ayr for dinner, but made a pit stop at a castle I saw on google, Dalquharran Castle
    	â¢ The driver there took me through the countryside, and I parked on the road out front some kinda machine shop, because the road to the castle didnât look like a drivable road
    	â¢ Turns out there was a no cars sign just out of view. Good intuition, good
    	â¢ A bit of a weird walk, because it was just through the woods between fields and along what seemed to be a very well trodden logging road
    	â¢ Took a trail that I thought pointed in the direction of the stonework I saw through the bushes but felt misled for a hot sec as it led to afield and then a giant wall of hedges
    	â¢ But the wall of hedges had a break in the hedge and the stone wall to a tunnel of hedges and then voila, a caste!!!
    	â¢ Turns out it was an abandoned/derelict castle. No idea the history behind it, but wouldâve guessed sometime 1800s. Maybe. Iâm not good at guessing
    	â¢ Well despite the stay out, danger, warning signs, there was a little hole in the wall that was conveniently not fenced in
    	â¢ In I went, of course!
    	â¢ Most of it looked to be gutted. Not just plaster and deco and such, but most of the floors/levels too
    	â¢ Lots of cavernous stuff and nature taking over. Pretty cool to see
    	â¢ Wandered my way down to the basement, a little weird and creepy
    	â¢ Then another round through the main castle, found the only intact staircase that took me all the way to the roof of one of the entry towers
    	â¢ Weird but awesome. Was really on edge at the top. Although atone is a pretty damn strong material, I had no idea how old this stone was, and I was four stories up. Really sweating it
    	â¢ Despite that, wandered a few ramparts, not too far, to explore some more viewpoints, and gave a verbal confirmation to two other folks that there was someone else there, just so no one got surprised
    	â¢ After a while, wandered to the other building, maybe used to be a stable or something, and it was quite a dump. Smelt of urine and was muggy and garbage all over the place
    	â¢ From there I meandered out. Definitely a cool as hell find!!!
    	â¢ Off to Ayr
    	â¢ Got parked and didnât have to pay (!!!) but after walking past what I thought was the right spot a couple of times, called the restaurant I was pining to try because it looked like their seafood was killer, and despite the website saying they were open they were closed. Damn
    	â¢ Hemmed and hawed trying to find a fallback, and landed on one close by
    	â¢ Again the weird-ish feeling of dining out alone. But nice spot. Got some salmon thrown into my salmon Mac and cheese and the waitress was super friendly and helpful
    	â¢ From there, was walking back to the car but audibled for a beer. In a cool spot and named the Smoking Goat. Hard to beat
    	â¢ Got a Lager of some sort and sat on their patio. Slowly dipped and got caught up on a few things
    	â¢ From there, off to find a place to park and camp. Realized how perfect that spot on the first night with the treees/brush between the parking spot and the roadway
    	â¢ Went to spot one, but it was on a decent hill and right at a fairly well traveled intersection. Wasnât feeling it
    	â¢ Headed off to spot two, and that was even more wel traveled, right on the edge of town, but it was a bit away from the roadway.
    	â¢ Parked , got situated and kinda crashed. Again a tossy turny night due to my back and the lights of cars and roadway



    2021.09.01
    	â¢ First day of September brings sunshine!!! First time in Scotland
    	â¢ Lazy getting put back together, but an early start
    	â¢ Went to get breakfast, cafÃ© didnât look to exist. Audibled for the unhealthy option but it got me a little taste of Canada! Timbits!!!
    	â¢ On the way to Troon stopped off near the airport to do some plane watching. Looked like (but wasnât) and Antonov on the runway. Beast, but unfortunately not it
    	â¢ Off to troon, circled around to Drift, a cafÃ© on the main drag for an aÃ§aÃ­ bowl (felt required to have something healthy) and a coffee with my book.
    	â¢ Reading and listening to a book. Most literary activity in a while
    	â¢ Gotta say, much bigger fan of taller coffee mugs than the tea/cappuccino-type mugs. Feel better in your hand. Tea ones are too dainty
    	â¢ After breakfast/coffee I wanted to put some shorts on with the weather heating up
    	â¢ The public toilet was where I parked, so thatâs where I tried to go, but damn thing required 30pence to go in. I tried to jump the gate but it started beeping at me. Damnit
    	â¢ Went back to my car and got the only coin I had, a 1pound. Three it in, but the machine didnât accept that coin, so it was stuck. Tried to fish it out, but the damn thing wouldnât get outta there
    	â¢ While I was looking like an idiot, an older dude came in and looked at me like I was an idiot. Asked what I was doing and then asked me to give him my shorts I was gonna change into. Super weird question, so naturally I hesitated. After the third request, gave them to him, and he just waved them behind the gate to trip the sensor so I could get in. What a wily old bastard :-)
    	â¢ Got changed, brushed my teef, and off on an exploratory walk!
    	â¢ Cool waterfront in town. Low tide, early morning, so lots to see and not a ton of commotion
    	â¢ Wandered along the waterfront, up a nice grassy knoll on the water, and then down to a delightful bench
    	â¢ Enjoyed the water and my book for abut, then noticed a coast guard helicopter just hovering over yonder, so I wandered down to the beach to try to get closer
    	â¢ Kept hovering, and I checked out some tide pools
    	â¢ Got bored and moseyed back to the road, then the helicopter got to moving
    	â¢ Back to the road, walked to the end of the pier that was open, said hi to some seagulls, and then saw a whole pack of seals bobbing on the water waiting to mooch some fish from any fishing boats I loafing their catch. No dice for them
    	â¢ Kept going along the harbor through the indistrial part and then back to the city part
    	â¢ Another bench on another nice grassy area
    	â¢ Then circled back to town on the hunt for lunch
    	â¢ Portland street!!!
    	â¢ Went into a bar to see if they had food, no just booze, but the lady asked the guys at the other end of the bar for any seafood recommendations
    	â¢ Got one, but didnât go with it, ended up going with
    	â¢ The Harbor Bar. Such a straight to the point kinda name and location
    	â¢ Got in, got a spot in the beer garden, and waited. Thankfully I got my beer at the bar while asking some questions
    	â¢ Turns out the waitress was new and still getting her sea legs under her. Super friendly gal and was doing just fine
    	â¢ Did a good bit of reading and got the Keep it Shrimple hobo, which is what they call shrimp dumped over fries. Turns out it was pretty damn good. So was the beer
    	â¢ From there, wandered back to the car kinda back along the way I came
    	â¢ Wanted to go to the bathroom before leaving and was ready to reuse the trick the older guy showed me. Just my luck, it was closed and out of order. Might that have been meâ¦?
    	â¢ And on the road. Google really likes finding the most direct route which is definitely not always the most well traveled route. Way too many blind corners and feeling like Iâm driving down someoneâs drivewayâ¦ maybe thatâs the uk, but googles getting a little cheeky in my opinion
    	â¢ Got to Elderslie for a little trip down Scottish History lane
    	â¢ Despite never having seen Braveheart, I had to stop in to a monument dedicated to the hero of Scottish Independence, William Wallace. The site was presumed to be where he lived for a majority of his youth before becoming the helm of the movement for Scottish Independence, which, as I learned, was passed on to Robert the Bruce a few years after Wallace passed.
    	â¢ The main sign said that the gas station next door had a pamphlet to read further but they didnât. The lady said the signs at the monument were a little oldâ¦
    	â¢ Cool monument, afterward on to Glasgow
    	â¢ Wasnât that far away, and kinda surprised at driving into Glasgow. Despite it being the largest city in Scotland, no skyscrapers noted on the drive in. Honestly a fairly flat skyline from the arrival into town
    	â¢ Got to the hotel and parking spot right out front. Thank god, because I was/am really worried about leaving my bike on it, despite the bike rack lock and two u locks. Gah
    	â¢ Iâm and situated, laid around for a bit, then off to walk around  Glasgowâs west end
    	â¢ Hotel was right next to a big park (unfortunately no bocce or whatever game is played on the mana cured grass courts), so started off there
    	â¢ The parked melted into the university of Glasgow, fourth oldest in the UK, âChanging the world since 1451â, sweet tag line
    	â¢ Walked through the main building. Impressive and old. Wasnât that the inspiration to some degree for Hogwarts?
    	â¢ Meandered through campus. Wanted to go up the library for a view of the city since the Glasgow tower was closed, but library for students only. Boooo
    	â¢ Continued walking through campus, through a touristy cobblestone street thatâs apparently popular, then down a commercial street, and slowly toward the Clyde river
    	â¢ As I got towards the tall ship and museum it was nearby, I could see they were setting up some kind of rigging or stage or something, and there were a few guys that had just placed a temporary fence along the path I was headed for
    	â¢ I ask what theyâre setting up for. Guy answers some kind of music festival that starts on Friday. No idea which one or what kind of music, but I get bummed because Iâm leaving Friday morning.
    	â¢ The oldest and fattest guy of the group, without skipping a beat - âoh arenât you a little to old for that nowâ¦â not in the form of a question.
    	â¢ Well fuck. No hiding it nowâ¦
    	â¢ A good bit dejected, I walked on and weaved my way through the quasi construction site to finally get to the waterfront path
    	â¢ Nothing like a city with an appreciable body of water in or through it. Seriously. Changes everything
    	â¢ Walked along the Ayer front to the first bridge so I could cross and go see the big tower
    	â¢ Really bummed it was closed, but cool to see it up close. Majority of the shape was similar to an airfoil. And watched a snippet of the âabout meâ video for the tower, and the whole thing rests on a 65cm ball bearing so the whole tower can rotate. Cool shit
    	â¢ Had California Honeydrops - Tell Me (I Wanna Know) stuck in my head for the whole time Iâd beenwalkkkg. Put me in a real good mood, but now I had to listen to it. Great song
    	â¢ Beautiful sunset as I got up and kept walking on the opposite bank. Pictures of bridges and the gigantic old crane just left on the bank
    	â¢ Crossed thr squinty bridge then slowly made my way back toward the hotel
    	â¢ Needed food, and stat
    	â¢ Went with my gut and the first place had already closed their kitchen, so back track to a Persian joint. Money
    	â¢ Got some lamb kabobs and shit it was good
    	â¢ Sitting at the one table on thr street, there was a group of three gals who were standing their waiting for their takeout
    	â¢ At first it annoyed me having people kinda hovering over me while I sat irate, but after a while it was amusing to listen to their chatter.
    	â¢ Delicious food, then needed a beer. Got a good ipa from Ireland that the dude accurately said had a good hint of amber to its taste. Yummy
    	â¢ Got some reading in, back to the hotel, then to the store for a power adapter; then bed

    2021.09.02

    	â¢ Waking up, not fun. Kinda rolled around for the two hours leading up to my alarm
    	â¢ Ready to go and down for breakfast, found out it wasnât included. No worries! Off to cafÃ© it up
    	â¢ Ottoman Coffeehouse on the way to the city center, perfect
    	â¢ Got in, got the biggest chocolate croissant Iâve ever seen, it was delicious, to go with some coffee
    	â¢ Delicious breakfast to go with my book
    	â¢ From there, back on the the somewhat cold/fresh streets and into town
    	â¢ Meandered the streets, so some fancy Schmauch cars; then off to the piping (bagpipe) museum!!!
    	â¢ Cool to see how bagpipes grew as an instrument, and become a sign of pride, strength, clandom, a battle procession, so much
    	â¢ Finally understood how the damn thing works too. Bout time
    	â¢ Out back into the city and into the thick of it
    	â¢ Walked down tourist row and man, Iâm not a fan of shopping districts and main city areas. Meh
    	â¢ Meandered through, then headed towards the big park in town with the Peopleâs Palace
    	â¢ Damnit. That whole park was predominantly closed due to setup for a different festival. Damnitâ¦
    	â¢ Walked around it and got to the riverfront walkway and strolled back towards town
    	â¢ Had to watch the clock, and got back to near where I needed to be and headed for lunch. Google showed there was an Afghan restaurant briefly across the bridge. Boom. Done
    	â¢ Got in, seated, ordered, then for some reason took off my glasses. Good thing I did, because the left arm of them was about to lose the screw!!! What the hell, the flange was bent and the screw was ready to pop out. Nothing happened that I remember so had no idea wtf happened
    	â¢ Ordered and got some naan and hummus to go with it
    	â¢ Salad, delicious, especially with the sauces (red was best). Naan and hummus, also delicious (also with a dribble of the red sauce on top. Then the lamb chapiti came, and with two discs of naan. Holy shit a lot of food. But damn it was delicious
    	â¢ Couldnât finish it all, but got the extra to go
    	â¢ Bolted out of there and headdd to the closest glasses shop to see if they could fix my glasses
    	â¢ Long story short, kinda. The guy was super nice and ready to help, but they didnât have the right tools to help. Got it to a point where it was screwed in enough to hold for a while, I just couldnât fold the glasses together or else the screw would pop out again. Damn. At least it was servicebabl
    	â¢ Then off to the Street Art tour! Super glad I did that
    	â¢ Met up with the group and I felt bad for the tour leader cause she had to shout pretty much at every stop with the city all around her
    	â¢ Cool to learn about the culture/rules of street art and graffiti
    		â If youâre well known and respected, less likely others will tag or paint over you
    		â A black line through your work is the biggest insult you can get
    		â Most of its illegal, but the commissioned stuff can get you a pretty penny
    		â Different ways to paint - stencil, freehand, projection, and maybe more
    	â¢ Incredible the level of detail possible on auch massive works of art
    	â¢ Liked negative destination with his little cactus guys, and the ones that Iâd seen the day before
    	â¢ Incredibly impressive works of art. Really cool to see and experience
    	â¢ Got to chatting with a couple at the end of the tour, fellow residents of glasgow
    	â¢ Derrick and Susan after the street art tour. Chatted over the art at first, and since this was the first deeper interaction Iâd had with some scots I asked them about the independence referendum, surprised, he was against it. Works in finance and his company (and others) said if itâs a yes theyâre moving out. Kinda felt similar to brexit in that sense
    	â¢ We chatted about politics and the state of the world and such, then headed out for a beer
    	â¢ Great conversation and laughs and all that, really nice folks
    	â¢ Had to piss like a race horse and they wouldnât let me pay for the bill
    	â¢ Exchanged contact info and plan is to meet up once Iâm on my way back down through Edinburgh
    	â¢ From there headed back to the hotel and saw my other plans fell through, open evening
    	â¢ Back to the hotel for stable wifi and my fantasy football draft. Aaron Rodgers baby. Letâs go.
    	â¢ Finished drafting but finished up my leftovers from lunch in the process. Damn good stuff
    	â¢ Down to the nearest place that looked like they had whiskey. Got the recommendation of the Bunnahabhain and a recommendation on a beer to go with it
    	â¢ Got to pet a cute lab a have a brief chat with the dudes sitting next to me outside, otherwise getting caught up on blog notes and people watching
    	â¢ From there off to bed

    2021.09.03
    	â¢ Time to leave Glasgow, bummer. Definitely a cool town with more to explore
    	â¢ First things first was breakfast at The Brunch Club. Some pretty good eggs Benny with too little hollandaise and some damn good bacon
    	â¢ Said hi to a puppy on the way out and learned that pit bulls are illegal in Scotland (wtf!!?). They gal brought him with from Texas and says heâs some kind of Stafford terrier mix or something to get away with it
    	â¢ With that in the car, had to stop aT St Munro first, beautiful piece of street art
    	â¢ On the road again
    	â¢ Either Google loves to take me through the most backroad routes, or there are just so few main roads the back roads are the only way. Could be both
    	â¢ After a quick drive I rolled up to Glengoyne for my first distillery visit! Not sure why this was on my maps, as Iâd never been, but I marked it at some point so there had to be a good reason
    	â¢ Early, so walked up to the waterfall, chatted with Owen the tour guide for a bit, then soon enough we were off
    	â¢ Technically not allowed to take pictures, but you know me :-) A couple cool things about Glengoyne:
    		â a Highland Single Malt whisky
    		â 100% renewable energy powered
    		â known as a slow distiller, where the second distillation is done at a slower pace than other distilleries 2x5L/min instead of 1x10L/min
    		â they still use wooden washbacks and are one of a small group of distilleries to do so (fun facts!!! The wood used for these things is Oregon Pine because the branches are all at the top of the tall trees with no knots in the middle. No knots = no seepage! Second, those things cost about $60,000. Dayum
    		â the only step in the process they donât do onsite is the step with the mash
    		â The Daff/Draff is no longer used for animal feed, but now as fuel for biogas energy gen
    	â¢ Cool tour, but I did the responsible thing since Iâm driving and got my tastings to-go. Wanted to try them out but held off
    	â¢ Jumped to the store, got a small bottle and back to the car
    	â¢ Ready to go hike Ben Lomond after some lunch, but google maps popped up with an attraction nearby. Hadnât heard of it, looked interesting though, so I was off to check it out
    	â¢ Super glad I did!!! Devilâs pulpit, essentially this anomaly of a canyon right in the middle of a bunch of farm fields
    	â¢ Not a long canyon, the inlet and outlet, where it goes from field to canyon and vice versa, are both within a 10ish minute walk from side to side
    	â¢ Incredible natural thing though, super deep, at least 40-50ft down to the floor
    	â¢ Walked around, checked it out from above then saw that there were two spots where you could go down into it! How dope! Definitely did
    	â¢ Way cool stop, such an unexpected treat!
    	â¢ From there, off to go hike Ben Lomond and atppped for food along the way
    	â¢ The Clachan Inn, licensed in 1734
    	â¢ Got lucky with parking, as where Iâd parked was technically illegal although there was a line of cars parked there. Iâm that moment though the parking inspectors were coming through so I asked and got the clarity I needed
    	â¢ Before I pulled away though the one guy asked where my car was registered, I said Germany, and he replied that they wouldnât be able to get the money from me ilanyeays. Good to know but I moved Rupert anyways
    	â¢ Got to the Inn and sat at the bar. Got a nice amber from Belhaven, eventually got my burger ordered, was watching the BBC news reel, and briefly chatted with the two gents at the bar
    	â¢ The one, older dude, said that heâd officially been to all 50 US states, impresssive! And Hawaii, specifically Kauai was his favorite. Also bummer, one of the bartenders (older gal, coulda been owner or something) asked him about his wife and sheâs going through some serious medical issuesâ¦ :-/
    	â¢ The other guy was middle age-ish and gave me a tip about the North Coast 500 and a story of when he did it, told me about a piping family memorial on the isle of skye, then after the older guy left shifted all the way down the bar, away from me, and that ended any chatter. Kinda weird
    	â¢ Burger was good, messy, but finished up and on my way
    	â¢ Got to the parking lot and didnât have enough of the right change for parking, so left a note and hoped for the best
    	â¢ Off and up we go!
    	â¢ Start was all kinds a warm and humid through the brush, but eventually got through that and soon after above the tree line and the views were great up and down Loch Lomond
    		â Why is the tree line so low in Scotland?
    	â¢ Slowly further up, and closer to the clouds. Tried to enjoy the views while they were there
    	â¢ Soon enough up beyond the cloud level and varying levels of reduced visibility
    	â¢ Every now and then a ridge line or other hill would be visible, but not often
    	â¢ Last stretch was steep, but eventually made it and thankfully there was something to signify Iâd made it, because there was zero view. White in all directions
    	â¢ Loitered enough to eat a banana then headed down
    	â¢ Bad knees, but kinda zoned out on the way down to the point of giving myself a refresher on geometry. Why.
    	â¢ Back to the car and boom, no issues with the parking ticket
    	â¢ Kinda wasnât motivated to do anything or go anywhere, so lazily unwound. Had my supermarket snack pack dinner down by the water just taking in the gorgeous views
    	â¢ Hit the road in search of a place to park camp and sleep
    	â¢ Spot one was not as secluded as I hoped
    	â¢ Backtracked and found a spot. Gnight

    2021.09.04
    	â¢ Woke up to an email from Derek with a hint that island life might be shut down on sundays
    	â¢ Shit, check the whiskey tours!

    		â Kilchoman - closed sun mon
    	â¢ Bummed, and a good bit upset thinking my goal of enjoying the Islay Whiskey potpourri might be in jeopardy
    	â¢ Packed up and hit the road opting for finding a spot along the way to eat my breakfast
    	â¢ Found that spot on the other side of Loch Lomond. Easy breakfast with bread pbj and a banana. Good time to calm down think things through and ride the wave. Nothings perfect and shit happens, gotta deal with it with a level head
    	â¢ Back on the road, more Shantaram and trying to enjoy the scenery. Too many trees covering the roadway which made the latter hard
    	â¢ Got to Arrochar on the way to Thr ferry and hit the loo and did some looking up. This time remembering thereâs a ferry required to even get to Islay
    	â¢ As luck would have it, no ferries from that place on the day. Only one with space was out of Oban
    	â¢ Had to cancel (rebook after deliberation) the one tour Iâd booked and do a u-turn to head to Oban instead
    	â¢ Quite the change in plans, but at least I had a spot on the ferryâ¦
    	â¢ On the way, made another pit stop to take it easy, think things through, and do some planning
    	â¢ Got a request from Ardnahoe if I wanted to cancel or reschedule. Tough to say, because I wanted to leave Islay on Monday, but they didnât open up til Tuesday
    	â¢ After some deliberation, I went against the original plan and opted for leaving the island on Tuesday. Opting for a more relaxed pace, taking it slow and easy, and making sure I didnât rush myself. And the benefit was more whiskey experiences. But honestly the biggest pull was forcing myself to take it slower and at a more relaxed pace. Iâm on vacation for peatâs sake
    	â¢ Cue the introduction to a delightfully inquisitive little bird
    	â¢ Got curious and shocked me the first time he flew up and sat on the window sill
    	â¢ Not wanting to scare him off, and wanting to see how trusting he was, I stuck out my finger to see if heâd use it as a perch
    	â¢ Never did, but worked his way up to the side mirror, and then back to the window sill
    	â¢ A bit of a game of cat and mouse as I shuffled in my chair and he came in and out of view. Pretty little bird and a nice little Companion to tell me to cool down and enjoy what comes
    	â¢ Eventually put in a call to get a campsite on Islay, got my ferry off the island booked, and a bit more planning for my whiskey fun while on the island. Things were coming together with that little birds help
    	â¢ Kept driving, wanting to get food before the tasting at Oban, so stopped at a smokehouse sign I saw along the road
    	â¢ Good place, maybe went a little overboard with salmon cheeses and more
    	â¢ Snagged a toastie of ham and smoked cheddar (aka grilled cheese), it was delicious, then back on the road to get to Oban on time
    	â¢ Cool coming into town from the desolate nature to a pretty hopping harbor and touristy destination
    	â¢ Parked right out front the distillery, which was right in the heart of downtown on the water
    	â¢ Eventually got started with Jim the lively salesman of a Glaswegian and two other parties from the US
    	â¢ The experience was a little less personal than at Glengoyne, but some delicious whiskey to taste and learn about.
    	â¢ Some new info:
    		â Whiskey Must be aged at least three years to be called whiskey
    		â Whiskey Must be at least 40% ABV to be called whiskey
    		â the Angelâs Share (the whiskey lost to evaporation during maturation) is an actual taxable quantity
    		â The four (I thought 5) whiskey regions of Scotland, and what each region tends to taste like
    	â¢ Oban is definitely a different whiskey than some others I know. Good, but not quite my alley
    	â¢ Good little tasting experience, and got a free tasting glass to go with it. Dope
    	â¢ From there, got some midgee spray then off to the ferry
    	â¢ The guy at the booth turned me around saying I was way too early. Bummer
    	â¢ Strove towards out of town and ended up stopping at Lidl to stock up on grub
    	â¢ Got grub and ice and filled the cooler, ended up giving the extra ice to some folks in a vanagan
    	â¢ Went and parked with the plan to walk around town

    	â¢ A
    	â¢ Oban felt like Bergen
    	â¢ Mid-stop island on the ferry, would love to have a reason to go there, find a house to rent on a stormy week, and just post up, maybe for romantic reasons, and just cozy in at a house so inaccessible and far from everything

    	â¢ Lagavulin
    		â 2017 jazz fest cask
    		â 12 year cask
    		â Aggressive use of the peat, enough for 100k yearsâ¦
    		â 2021 jazz fest cask, 13yr triple maturation
    		â Distillery exclusive bottle
    		â Mill in the Hollow (Laâ Vulin)
    		â Single Cask sample (random sample)
    			Â§ Hard to get, likely only at distilleries
    	â¢ Islay wildlife
    		â Almost running over a bunny thr first night on the way to the campsite
    		â Getting scared shirtless by a pheasant as I was less than a stride away from it
    		â Seeing bunnies, a deer, more pheasants or grouse, and a hawk with its prey on the drive out of the lighthouse
    	â¢ Full day on the small (but actually big) island
    	â¢ Breakfast and shower, easy, nice start to the day
    	â¢ Off to Lagavulin with a stop to fail at getting ice along the way
    	â¢ Lagavulin, see above
    	â¢ From there, off on an adventure
    	â¢ First to thr castle right out front of lagavulinâs little bay
    	â¢ Ended up being an archaeological team from University of Reading excavating thr castle to discover its history. How cool! That was their third dig season, and on the first they discovered a crest housed in the museum, gotta check that out
    	â¢ Got some cool pictures, infatuated with two boats on the shore, and climbed around the castle for a bit. Cool stuff
    	â¢ From there, drove out to the end of the road. Or at least the end on the SE corner of the island
    	â¢ Thought there was a trail, there was at least on the map, so went for it. Goal - lighthouse
    	â¢ Turns out the trail has not been maintained in a godawfully long time, or thr trail is a conglomeration of tractor paths that never get used
    	â¢ Either way, majority of thr trek was bushwhacking
    	â¢ Got to the first ridge with the majority of the route in view and was ready to just turn around. It seemed too far, didnât want to bushwhack, and meh
    	â¢ Checked the duration on maps.me and it said an hour. Gut call and went for it
    	â¢ Went faster than I thought
    	â¢ Got down from the ridge to skirt the beaches, and crazy just how desolate and empty (not the right word) yet immense the landscape was
    	â¢ Purple bushes and their flowers mixed with the yellows and greens of the grass made for some beautiful colors and color palates
    	â¢ Got to the beach, bookmarked the first spot for a chill out on the return trip
    	â¢ Motored on, better going along the water. Very Rocky beach
    	â¢ Came up to an abandoned house, or a former wilderness shelter. Could be either. But there were some building ruins next to the non ruins, coulda been anything
    	â¢ Either way, the buildings made a wonderful prop in the pictures. Desolate landscape with abandoned building. Picturesque
    	â¢ Kept plugging and got to the end of the beaches, now time to ascend the ridge to get up and over the cliff
    	â¢ Not a ton of up, but it was a slog with the bushwhacking
    	â¢ Tons of cerns and sticker bushes
    	â¢ A good number of false summits, but eventually got to the point where I could see the lighthouse!
    	â¢ Always called it good and just turned around, but dropped my pack, grabbed my camera, and hiked down to the lighthouse
    	â¢ Was in a weirdly fenced in area, went around one side and dead ended, then other side to get in
    	â¢ Fully automated lighthouse, saw the banks of batteries inside and the solar panels up top
    	â¢ Loitered around the lighthouse for a bit, then back up to my bag
    	â¢ Before leaving, popped a squat in the grass and bush
    	â¢ Serenely beautiful spot
    		â In a sparsely populated country
    		â On a remote and sparsely populated island
    		â Past the end of the road
    		â A good 2 hour hike in
    		â On a hillside overlooking the ocean
    		â No one around, and for someone to get to me, itâs an easy multiple hour journey
    		â Nothing but the wind and the rustling of the grass
    	â¢ Really a gorgeous and remote spot, but the bug in my head kept annoying me telling me I could t/shouldnât hang out too long
    	â¢ Really annoying thing in the back of my head
    	â¢ Did my best to enjoy it, but hit the road back, way before I wanted to
    	â¢ Bushwhacking down the cliff was way easier than coming up, soon enough back down to the beach
    	â¢ Super white and find sand at the beach, kinda cool
    	â¢ Wandered down the beach, back past the house, and to the rain checked beach
    	â¢ Got there and went into a lounge, quite comfy, quite remote, and quite relaxing
    	â¢ Slowly, a couple rain drops. Then slightly picked up
    	â¢ Wasnât gonna let rain ruin my quiet time, so rain jacket, pans, and pack cover, and I was rain-proofed and still sitting there
    	â¢ Similar feeling to before. Remote and relaxing
    	â¢ Same bug as before though too, and didnât stAy as long as I wouldâve like
    	â¢ Trucking and whacking on back
    	â¢ Took a couple better turns and skipped a. If hill
    	â¢ Got scared shitlrss from a pheasant who waited til I was a single stride away to scream out of the bush it was hiding I
    	â¢ Had to jump a fence and then back over,  it found my way out of there
    	â¢ Pretty wet by the time I was out
    	â¢ Got to Rupert, de-rain geared, and got warmed back up
    	â¢ Nommmed on a cookie. I love cookies
    	â¢ Then the slow trek back
    	â¢ Stopped in Port Ellen to get breakfast stuff
    	â¢ Indian food for dinner, it was ok. Guy was a little cagey if they had space for me,  it it all worked out
    	â¢ UK roads are absolute shit. Super bumpy auf rutty and full of puddles and bumps, fuck. Terrible quality regardless of where or what.
    	â¢ Tire pressure light came on likely because of that
    	â¢ After dinner, pooped. Not a crazy busy day, but still long and very cool
    	â¢ On my own, not good about thinking about things, deliberating. Have a huge decision to make, and have so far taken little to no time to think it over. So focused on the trip and what to do and what to plan, that I havenât given myself the space to contemplate my choice outside of some cursory moments. Leaning towards extending though


    2021.09.06

    	â¢ Earlier start than I expected, but good to go
    	â¢ CafÃ© wouldnât let me eat my breakfast inside, so bummed around the car and auch
    	â¢ After commiserating on whether to stay in Germany or not to so many people and over so many months, I finally gave my decision.
    	â¢ Waking up to a message from my boss asking for an update for HR, I kinda knew it was about time to give an answer on the situation. I am bad at deliberating on things on my own, and havenât taken time to think it over during this trip. Despite that, Iâd already been tending toward a direction, and in that call, gave my boss the agreement that Iâll sign on for another two years and see how long I actually make it.
    	â¢ Not an easy decision, and still not convinced itâs the right decision. But itâs the decision Iâve made, and now need to stand by it and make the most out of what comes from it.
    	â¢ Eventually started my trip over to Bunnahabhain
    	â¢ Easy drive; then on the single lane road to the distillery
    	â¢ Truck oncoming, so I backed up to what I thought was a lay away
    	â¢ Turns out, back into a ditch. Fuck me
    	â¢ Called the distillery, they told me to head back down the road to the previous house/farm/bnb and talk to a guy named Wilf to pull me out
    	â¢ Ran over, jogged, because I didnât want to miss out on. The tasting
    	â¢ No one in the courtyard, empty, called some numbers and no answer
    	â¢ Walked over to the door for enquirers, opened it, and barged in on thr mr and mrs as they were packing to head to the ferry. Felt like a dick
    	â¢ But talked to Ronald, aka Wilf, and asked if he could help
    	â¢ Told me to start walking back and heâs come over to take a look
    	â¢ Walked back, worried Iâd be left high and dry
    	â¢ Soon as I was back to the car, he rolled up with his tractor. Bing bang boom and I was out. Easy as pie. Super nice gentleman to help. Gave him something in thanks and told him Iâd come by Persabus next time Iâm on the island for a drink with him
    	â¢ Rupert removed from the ditch, I was off to the distillery
    	â¢ Got in, helped by a wonderful man named Colin and led into the warehouse for thr tasting
    	â¢ Easily the coolest experience this far, tasting in the maturation warehouse with casks all around and sitting in church pews with Rodney leading us through the tasting
    	â¢ Missed the first dram but made it for the last three, great tastes and whiskies
    	â¢ Bunnahabhain
    		â Missed manzanita 54.2, 2008
    		â Pedro Ximenez Noe - 51.2, 2004
    		â #3 cask unknown - 45.5%
    		â Dunnagh warehouse (dunnagh, type of location, mold blood sweat whiskey maturation)
    		â Avg angels share 1.5%
    		â #4 moine PX 2004, 7 yr cask finish, 52.8%
    	â¢ After the tasting, bumming around the shop with the rest of the tasting crew
    	â¢ Got the insider scoop to try the 18yr, and then a different one
    	â¢ Chatted with James and his friend and their wives about Scotland
    	â¢ Tip to hike Beinn Alligin near Torridan, thenInverness, and the Falkirk wheel and the Kelpies, all great tips!!!
    	â¢ They seemed like a fun bunch, first vacation in a while without their kids, and off to golf later
    	â¢ Got myself a yummy bottle, the fourth from the tasting, and ran into issues with my camera, it wouldnât turn on,,, :-(
    	â¢ All good with thr camera, just Uber dead batteries
    	â¢ After the tasting, felt a bit quite aimless, just Unrushed to do anything
    	â¢ So I pulled off the road overlooking thr bay with Bowmore across the way, whipped out my chair, and celebrated with some smoked mussels (absofuckinglutely delicious) and some pretzel goldfish (kinda meh) while looking out on the calm bay on a grey and breezy day
    	â¢ Had a nice relaxing time sitting there, and was feeling a nap coming on
    	â¢ But rather than nap, I stopped off at the Museum of Islay Life to get a little more history on the place
    	â¢ Tons of cool artifacts and neat information on the island and itâs people
    	â¢ A few interesting connections to the US - sunken ships and immigration the main ones
    	â¢ Saw the crest that was dug up by the archaeology crew! Tiny medallion
    	â¢ Cool museum visit then back to the campground
    	â¢ Bummed around, read, then took a nap I. Thr car because it was raining and didnât want to move from my reading chair
    	â¢ Pretty damn good car nap, got a good hour or so it felt like. Needed that for sure
    	â¢ Took a while to find the motivation, but up and motored over to Portnhaven
    	â¢ Went there for food at a place, but parked, chatted with an old lady sitting at her doorstep, and rather than going straight for food, grabbed my camera and lens and did a walk about
    	â¢ Gorgeous little port town. Quiet, gentle harbor nestled behind two small islands. A very sheltered alcove and perfect for a harbor
    	â¢ Walked around, saw two old ladies doing a relaxed water aerobics thing in the sound, took some pics of thr boats and birds and deer and seals, and got in a nice little meander
    	â¢ On the far side, plopped on a bench looking in the direction of Ireland and enjoyed the view and calm sea air
    	â¢ On the circle back to town, popped onto a bench overlooking thr harbor
    	â¢ Some point two bike tourists rose into town, so I chatted with thr two Glaswegian for a good bit. Seemed like two nice fellows
    	â¢ Popped down to the bar - closed. Goddamnit
    	â¢ Went and sat by the water for a bit. But went back and thr bar was definitely closed. Bummer
    	â¢ Back to thr campground, got a delicious wrap and a beer, ate and drank, kinda got my car situated and such, then off to bed
    	â¢ Notes on Islay
    		â All/most buildings are painted white with the trim being the accent color. There predominantly black
    		â Likely more sheep than people
    		â A jeep wave, but with everyone
    		â Didnât matter how many times I drove a stretch, seemed like a new route every time

    2021.09.07
    	â¢ Ferry, car alarms go off after the engines start churning
    	â¢ Corned beef, Blech. Not for me
    	â¢ Unicorn is the official animal of Scotland, Lion that of Britain

    	â¢ Woke up to the tent next to me having a loud fireside chat starting at 6am. Wtf
    	â¢ Rolled around for a while, then eventually got up
    	â¢ Showered and cleaned up, then packed all up. Wet rain fly was just gonna have to dry before fully packing it up
    	â¢ Motored out on a foggy but nice morning and over to Bowmore to the CoOp, groceries for thr day, including breakfast
    	â¢ From there, motored back on down south to the American Memorial
    	â¢ Helluva windy, rutty, single file road. Quite the ride
    	â¢ Stopped along the way for a few pictures and eventually made it to the parking lot
    	â¢ Parked, made and ate some breakfast, then figured itâs be more of a hike so put on my boots
    	â¢ Started off along a little dirt road and then bam, cliffs and an incredible view with some highland cattle thrown in
    	â¢ Seriously, what a gorgeous view
    	â¢ Found a bench and tried to take it all in, with the fog rolling over the peaks, the incredible cliffs at varying levels, and the waves just keeping on keeping on
    	â¢ Got up, went to another vantage point to view, then from there continued on trying to keep my head pointed at the view without falling off thr cliff
    	â¢ The walk continued up and around thr bend
    	â¢ But with thr cliff view remaining visible for a good while
    	â¢ Eventually came to a different cliff view, this one with thr monument on top. Incredible drop from the monument down
    	â¢ Crept close to the edge, great incredible views
    	â¢ Something at th bottom near the water kept making a noise, thought it was a seal or something, but couldnât get a glimpse of whatever was crying out
    	â¢ Slowly made my way over to the monument. Incredible structure for a harrowing remembrance
    	â¢ Canât imagine having a troop transport ship crash in that spot in the middle of winter and trying to survive. My goodness
    	â¢ Incredible views, and now able to look across the inlet to Portnhaben, where I was last night. Not able to make anything out, but it was there
    	â¢ Gorgeous hike, way more to it than what I anticipated and really happy I went and did it. Bummed I didnât have more time
    	â¢ From there, back to town
    	â¢ Got to Bowmore, ate a croissant and an apple at The harbor to kill time
    	â¢ Then to the distillery, had to wait out front for someone to collect us
    	â¢ But got collected and waited a hot second for Lynn to come and get us, me and a British couple for thr tasting
    	â¢ Whiskey and chocolate, quite the good pairing
    	â¢ Wasnât super blown away by any of the pairings. What I can say, white chocolate destroyed the whiskey. Tasted good before, tasted bland as hell after the white chocolate. Never againâ¦
    	â¢ Lynn was super nice, but felt like she was pandering to the British couple most of the time. Not intentional, Iâm of the quiet and non-attention-Hoggy nature, so that always happens
    	â¢ First thing we tried was the liquid before it gets mature. Interesting trick to douse it on your hand like rubbing alcohol, run your hands together to burn off the alcohol, then smell whatâs left. Smells like the malting process!!! Yummy!!!
    	â¢ Got done with our three prescribed tastes, and then got to try the David Simpson 20yr. Now that one was good. She said it was her favorite, and I can see why. Unfortunately a little too expensive for me
    	â¢ Got to try their vault edition, and that was ok, but not spectacular. Great to try it though, because the sun was fully out at that point and we had to taste them on the patio. Not bad
    	â¢ Ended up not getting a bottle. Surprised myself, but nothing stood out
    	â¢ Thanked Lynn, great and fun host
    	â¢ Then off to walk a bit around town and snap a few pics
    	â¢ Felt a little aimless and unmotivated, so got some coffee and a shrimp sandwich and ate it by the water. Was literally just shrimp salad thrown on bread, but tasted fantastic
    	â¢ A
    	â¢ Got off the ferry and was ready to drive
    	â¢ Shantaram getting to a few good spots, so had something to keep me going
    	â¢ Once I passed the slow cars it was green lights and clear pavement. Gotta say, Acotlanf is a drivers paradise with clear roads. Curvy, engaging. Dynamic, pretty damn awesome place to drive
    	â¢ Had a good clip and was in a good zone
    	â¢ Got close enough to Glencoe that I called it good and turned off, conveniently where google maps said the Skyfall mountain scene took place. Pretty cool
    	â¢ Milky Way before midnight. Got to a parking spot to sleep just in time to enjoy the Milky Way for a while before the clouds rollled in. Out in full glory, dark sky night. What a beautiful sight

    2021.08.09
    	â¢ A
    	â¢ Amazing nap at the top of the valley. Such a beautiful spot looking down the U shape to a small mountain then a big one behind it. Just gorgeous
    	â¢ Took my time enjoying that view. Such a peaceful situation with nothing but nature
    	â¢ Then slowly started the way down that valley. Kinda slow going, lots of big and a very poorly defined trail, but made it happen
    	â¢ Another dude came up behind me outta nowhere. Thought I was the only one on that trail. Not anymore
    	â¢ Got to the end of The Valley and thought Iâd have an easy stroll back to the car. Checked the map, 11km to go. Goddamnmotherfucker
    	â¢ Maps had me take the way less trodden route up and over a big hill and I was getting eaten alive by the damn flying spider things the whole time. Not about it, and souring fast
    	â¢ Was a ways til the next chance to hit the road and try my luck, but luckily enough there was a random bridge that popped up so it took it and hit the road
    	â¢ Car passes as soon as I got out there, damn, so started walking/jogging down the road
    	â¢ Passed by a van, no dice, but the sedan afterward of Anna the hiking guide and her two friends gave me a lift!!â Hot damn!!! My life (aka 2 hours and 5mi of walking) was saved!!!
    	â¢ Lovely chat with the ladies til they got dropped off, then talked with Anna the rest of the way. Talked with her about how to become a hiking guide. Donât have any teaching experience, and my patience is not the best, but maybe thatâs something for me?
    	â¢ Super stoked to be back at Rupert. Man. Nice to take the boots off
    	â¢ Went and âshoweredâ in the river to try and get as much sweat off my body as possible. I was feeling gross
    	â¢ On the way out, there were two folks looking to hitch back to town, so I gave them a lift. Pay it forward
    	â¢ Nice couple from Ireland, said to bring/have a car for traveling around their country. Sounds good
    	â¢ Super friendly folks, and I dropped them downtown
    	â¢ Headed to a parking spot and wanted to hit up a bar. Pizza and beer on my mind
    	â¢ First place no dice, second no dice, fuck it, donât wanna spend all night on a goose chase
    	â¢ The Irish folksâ recommendation it was and I snagged me a chicken tikka Marsala pizza then went to Tesco and got a beer then drove to the waterfront parking lot. Camp chair out, pizza on my lap and cold beer in the cup holder. Fuck yeah

    2021.09.09
    	â¢ Up and at em, reorganized my bags a bit
    	â¢ Breakfast at JJâs CafÃ©. Went with the British breakfast
    		â Beans, tried em and hell no
    		â Black pudding was some kinda hockey puck thing, it was ok
    		â Sausage tasted a little funky
    		â Ham was salty as hell
    		â And there was some kind of meaty bread loaf thing. Pretty ok
    		â Enjoyed what I could of that and smashed the bread and coffee
    	â¢ Food at Aldi, canât buy beer before 10am either. What the hell scotland. Had a good stout and porter selected and was looking forward to em.,.
    	â¢ Off to the Nevis Range (Fort William) Bike park. COMMENCE STOKEAGE!!!
    	â¢ Got in, couldnât buy passes until the gondola started, oh well, so filled up my water bottles and auch and got ready
    	â¢ But of a drizzle before things even started, but nothing I couldnât enjoy!!!
    	â¢ In line and up we Go, weird way to hang the bikes but letâs do this!
    	â¢ Top Chief black run to warm up. Rocks like woah. And uphill. Pretty decent trail though once it started going down
    	â¢ Stopped 2/3 down and jogged over to Qitchâs Goat. Awesome little trail of rocky berms through the trees, weaving in out and around everything. Fun
    	â¢ Now, on to the big shit. WORLD CUP DOWNHILL!!! Got super stoked on the gondola ride up
    	â¢ Got my girlâs puc with the starting hit, then had a couple hikers in the booth to âcheerâ me on to start
    	â¢ Holy shit what a trail. Such a great mix of everything! Some really rocky bits, blows my mind how the pros can just croooooose right on through them
    	â¢ Crazy how the pros can do this in 4ish minutes, took me over 10min, not including a crash and a couple breaks. Damn those dudes can rip!!!
    	â¢ Already pretty beat; after just two runs. The hike yesterday might not have been the best prep. But here we are!!!
    	â¢ Back to the lift line and had a lovely chat with an energetic lift worker
    	â¢ Asked me about thr trails, my bike, where Iâm from, and he was just all kinds of super friendly. Love the positivity and fun!!!!!
    	â¢ Gave the new blue one a try. Supposed to be flown and bermy, but didnât get that vibe. The berms either didnât seem to be tall enough or I wasnât comfortable enough laying into the really low berms. That and a lot of pedaling. Couldnât find a groove.
    	â¢ Back to Witchâs goat, thatâs a fun one
    	â¢ Lunch time. Chowed on my Aldi soggy wrap, had a banana, and read a chapter of my book. Quite the laid back lunch break :-)
    	â¢ After another World Cup run (crashed in the same spotâ¦ easy stuff but couldnât conquer that spot), chatted with two dudes from NW Britain. They, as me, donât have anything like this near home, so itâs a treat to get to ride this stuff. Theyâre headed to Glencoe soon, and a scot nearby tipped in and confirmed that Laggan is a great place to ride, so Iâm glad itâs on the list!
    	â¢ Went back up for a Top Chief lap, and outside of the sling wooden plank ride (I hate the combo of wood and rain, makes me uneasy regardless of how wide the path isâ¦) loved the run. Rocks all over the place felt like a math problem that I was nailing the whole way down. Then Withs goat again. Short but what a sweet bermy trail winding through trees
    	â¢ Got back to the bottom and a quick word with the dudes who lent me their pump and the chat from earlier, I grabbed my camp chair and joined them at their flan
    	â¢ Chris and Damien, on the annual voyage to Fort William, nice to hang and chat with them. Good (I guess) to hear that Covid a in the same state with them, as with elsewhere in the world, but theyâre getting through it. Also learned after my ignorant question that a quid is the exact same thing as a pound, neither weâre sure where quod came from
    	â¢ Had a nice chat with them, then broke off for the next run (they seemed to be and are much better riders than me), but after coming out of the loo they pulled right into the lift line so we shared a gondola up
    	â¢ Nice chats along the way, then I was toying with doing another World Cup run, but they opted for Top Chief, so I decided to join them for this one and come back up for another World Cup
    	â¢ Top Chief was unbelievably foggy. The rain had kept coming, so it was a little wetter (although the rocks were still super grumpy which was unheard of but awesome), and the fog held visibility down to what felt like no more than 20-30ft. It was dense
    	â¢ Worked through the wood section and the uphill, and then the downhill. Thatâs when I learned I was poooooped. Legs were a bit tired, but my hands and arms were limp fishing and ready to be done
    	â¢ Another fun lap on top Chief and then to witchâs goat, which again, was a blast. Mightâve been my favorite run. But really, all of them were incredible outside of the blue one
    	â¢ Pooped after an incredible day of riding at an incredible place, time to slowly tear off all the wet and dirty gear
    	â¢ Chris and Damien let me use their hand held pressure washer (and I forgot to explicitly thank them for that, big regret) which was way cool. I hope desalt make something like that
    	â¢ Slowly got all my stuff laid out in the car to dry and make super smell like a high school locker room, then said adios to Chris and Damien as they drove off, and heard into the cafÃ© for a cap and snack
    	â¢ Annoyed that drip coffe isnât a thing in Scotland
    	â¢ Got my coffee and scone and headed to the patio
    	â¢ Was gonna jump on wifi to look at weather and plan and such, but no wifi on the patio meant lay back and relax
    	â¢ There were some skid fish birds searching for crumbs and all kept an eye on me
    	â¢ Scone was way better with butter than with jam
    	â¢ Coffee was pretty good too
    	â¢ Drank and ate it all slowly and enjoyable, watching the trees and the chairlift so their thing
    	â¢ Eventually finished, I snuck back inside with a little coffee left to do my research and planning
    	â¢ Was kinda bummed and feeling a little unlucky and pouty because the forecast was bad for the next couple days regardless of what I was looking to do - thatâs Scotland, and I knew and prepared for that coming into it - but it still kinda got me down
    	â¢ A little bummed, I paid and left the parking lot and as a first step forced myself to get some groceries. As Iâve learned, just take that first step to get things rolling
    	â¢ Back to the Aldi to not go to Aldi because they didnât have a bakery, so went to the swanky-ass M&S Trader Joeâs type place next door
    	â¢ Grabbed my bananas and they were all empty at their bakery. No use paying a premium when what I was going for wasnât available.
    	â¢ Around this time noticed that the second crash hurt my knee a good bit
    	â¢ Googled and found a co-op (which Iâve found to be pretty reliable as theyâve got extended opening hours, and people on Islay were raving about them as well) and headdd over there
    	â¢ No English muffins anywhere on the shelves, Iâm in England for Christâs sake
    	â¢ Snagged enough to get by and then felt aimless and targetless again
    	â¢ Tended towards starting to make my way in the direction of Isle of Skye, but by way of the non-highway road to start
    	â¢ Doing so took me by Neptuneâs staircase, so I decided to stop in
    	â¢ Chowed on my sandwich to start, then off on a little walk
    	â¢ What a cool spot. Throughout my slow journey, I learned that I was driving through whatâs known as the Great Glen Way. Essentially a natural straight line from East to west coast of Scotland with a few lakes along the way caused by a fault like collision between two prehistoric continents way the hell back when
    	â¢ Well, 1800s Scotland said they needed a canal to connect the two coasts and by golly they did it, and Neptuneâs staircase was the west-end of the canal and a series of 7 locks along the canal right near the town of Fort William
    	â¢ So I walked the length of the locks and got some pictures and was in pretty clear awe of the swinging bridges
    	â¢ Rather than tilting up or opening or what it like other river bridges; this one (and one later) just spins/twists out of the way. How cool!!!
    	â¢ Cool, gorgeous walk in the grey around the locks. Pretty cool spot and great stop
    	â¢ Continued on the non-highway road on my way, and fun curvy winding Scottish road
    	â¢ Crossed theother swunfing bridge at the other end; then stopped off at a commando memorial commemorating the lost commandos in WWII and afterwards
    	â¢ Beautiful setting for a memorial, and gorgeous views of the landscapes with clouds hanging around and being gorgeous
    	â¢ Onward journey, and damn, empty Scottish highways (this one was in great condition surprisingly) are fun as hell to drive. Just kinda got in the zone and was really enjoying it
    	â¢ Stopped off again on an overlook at Loch Lochy (piecing it together means Lake Lakey, like a four year old named itâ¦)
    	â¢ Then cut over, continued enjoyment of driving
    	â¢ In and out of clouds and fog and bummed I couldnât see the full view of what I was driving through
    	â¢ Eventually found myself driving through a major valley and knew I had to pull off and camp soon, just so I could hopefully see the drive in better light in the morning
    	â¢ Eventually saw a Kong road cutting across The Valley and took it
    	â¢ Gorgeous spot from what I could see in the low light. Really looking forward to a hopefully clearer and brighter view in the morning. Feeling of beautiful desolation
    	â¢ Got some things reorganized, then grabbed my chair with my Bowmore 18-yr dram and sat with a dusky view
    	â¢ Somewhere in there in the very low light saw a couple of deer jaunting across The Valley
    	â¢ Then, bedtime

    2021.09.10
    	â¢ Up and at em, early again.
    	â¢ No breakfast, but cloudy and fairly gloomy with a beautiful landscape
    	â¢ Got squared away, snapped some pics, then hit the road
    	â¢ No timeline or clear destination; so took it slow and enjoyed the road
    	â¢ Took a few stops to enjoy the sights, and one longer one to get a good view of an sweet castle right on the water. Must have been quite the incredible spot in its hayday
    	â¢ Slowly rambled on and soon enough bud crossed the bridge (which is younger than me by 5yrs) and was on the Isle of Skye!
    	â¢ Unfortunately and weirdly, I was a little aimless and unsure what to do because of the weather. Knew rain was forecast and didnât want to get poured on, so wasnât set on jumping into any one thing
    	â¢ Topped off the tank and tried to get a plan, and then decided to drive out to the end of the first offshoot road from the highway. Elgol here we come
    	â¢ Beautiful drive out there. Slow, with a few spots with sheep and cattle on the roadway
    	â¢ Got out to Elgol and used the loo, and saw the monstrous old Arocs that was converted into a mega 6x6 off-roading motor home. Didnât get a good pic, but I saw it on Islay and damn that things a beast!
    	â¢ Was at the overlook and drove down to the harbor (steep roadways, would interest me to see how they cope in the winter!), and from the view was blown away by the mountains across the sound
    	â¢ So with that as a starting point, I started looking on the map for hiking trails
    	â¢ Sure enough, pieced together what I thought would be a good loop
    	â¢ No time to waste, back in the car and off to the trailhead!
    	â¢ Unfortunately the road from the main road wasnât a road but a hiking trail; so add 2mi each way to get to/from the loop Iâd scoped, but either way, here we go!
    	â¢ The hike in was meh, but passed a friendly group (assumed mom dad and daughter) and had a nice chat with them. They mentioned the Danny MacAskill video where heâs on Skye, gotta watch it again. Nice bunch, jealous they were headed to Talisker for a tasting that day
    	â¢ Motored on down the hill and entered the first amphitheater. A couple buildings on the pasture right at the beach with incredible mountains growing up behind them. Gorgeous
    	â¢ Made it down to the plain and motored across it, going by the old building, and saying hi to the older couple snacking at the hut.
    	â¢ From there, needed to cross the river. Didnât want to take my boots off so fording wasnât on the table. Had to backtrack up the river to find a spot with enough rocks and did. Success!
    	â¢ Now for out and around the peninsula
    	â¢ Trail went up a bit, and I got to say hi to four seals from above as they were lounging to the max
    	â¢ Continued on the trail with a few kayakers on the Water and entered the second amphitheater with the two Lochs and essentially an incredible bay
    	â¢ Scrambled around, sat for a while and waved to the kayakers and boaters (damn tourist boats) before making my way to the Bad Step
    	â¢ This was something talked about on a few sites, but a giant rock feature you had to maneuver to keep going
    	â¢ A little sketchy, but really not that bad
    	â¢ Got through there, greeted some kayakers on the beach and entered amphitheater 3. Super gorgeous. A lake just inside the bay, found a rock slab and got super comfy lounging around and admiring the incredible and intense rock structures all around
    	â¢ From there could see the trail I needed to ascend, so after a cat nap I got in my way
    	â¢ Up up up to a little bowl along the after fall
    	â¢ Trails here are just choose your own adventure for the most part and just bogs. Soaked
    	â¢ Didnât take too long to get to the bowl with a higher lane for amphitheater 4. Pretty, but pushed on to get to the top of the ridgeway insane to see how many gigantic boulders, each weighing a good 2-20 tons, looked to be testing in such a precarious spot that a mere toothpick was the only thing preventing them from rolling all the way down. Pretty nuts
    	â¢ Also kinda pushed to the top because of the midges and jumping spiders
    	â¢ Damn, peaked the ridge and another gorgeous amphitheater
    	â¢ Sat for a bit, then got the seventh ridge which blew me away.
    	â¢ Able to see down a super long Valley, to the highway essentially, and one super relaxed drawn out foothill just putting such a gorgeous natural line on the whole thing. Really mesmerizing
    	â¢ Whipped out my pretzel goldfish and chowed on them while admiring the view before finding another spot to lounge on a comfy rock and catnap. Gorgeous spot
    	â¢ Eventually up and headdd down, decided to cut the flat to save about a mile and jut straight to the trail headed back
    	â¢ Unfortunately the wind stopped and I got nothing but mauled, Midges everywhere and jumping spiders. Sheesh. I tried not to spot, reapplied my bug spray, and the damn things were still constantly attacking
    	â¢ Entered the last amphitheater but didnât take too much time to watch because of the midges
    	â¢ Decided on a connector trail to cut off some miles, but the trail was damn near invisible
    	â¢ Tried to keep with it, and eventually it got me to the main trail and out
    	â¢ At the junction, chatted with some hikers from Wales, they were happy to see someone else on the trail
    	â¢ I was itching to be done and take my boots off, so said adios and got my normal speed in gear up the hill and on the way
    	â¢ Unfortunately I ran completely dry of energy and the last bit was a slog
    	â¢ The folks caught up To me, so the chat as we walked back helped me out
    	â¢ Got a suggestion for Skye from them, then bud them adieu
    	â¢ Got packed up, and thought about camping there for the night, but decided against to head back to the big valley around thr corner
    	â¢ It started drizzling there as I pulled up, so pushed a bit further and found a spot
    	â¢ Got set up, made some food, and hit the sack

    2021.09.11
    	â¢ Slept like shit. Windy all night and was a worried about my bike, and rainy as hell so had to play with the windows
    	â¢ Didnât get much sleep, but eventually got all readjusted to get a move on
    	â¢ Back toward town, hit the loo, filled up on water, and then grabbed some breakfast because I was too lazy to make a pb and bagel
    	â¢ On the road. Grey morning, but quiet and serene
    	â¢ A couple scenic stops, then first longer stop was the Eas a Bhradain waterfall. Huge, impressive, super swampy, and rushes of water flowing likely due to the previous nightâs rain
    	â¢ Water was a real brown, maybe the iron in the rocks?
    	â¢ Wandered around there, and snapped some pictures of the fish farms in that bay. Big nets/cafes(?) of fishies
    	â¢ Motored on, stopped at a monument for a couple Scottish mountaineers, then on the road toward the fairy pools
    	â¢ Saw the fairy pools aka a group of waterfalls on the drive, and opted for heading again to the end of the road
    	â¢ Got there, pulled out my camp chair and just sat on the beach
    		â Kind of an off-axis wave pattern, with two lines of them intersecting
    		â A couple groups of birds hanging around
    		â The tiny ones were super agile in the air. Got to see a couple go after each other and it was my dynamic than a dogfight. Cool stuff
    	â¢ Nice and relaxing just watching the birds and trying to let it all go
    	â¢ Eventually, back in the car and off we go
    	â¢ Nixed the fairy pools, wasnât too intrigued by it
    	â¢ Continued on down the road and looked at the map. Turns out, Talisker distillery was close by so I figured that was a sign to head over!
    	â¢ Talisker distillery
    		â No tours, obv
    		â Chatted with the guy at the gate for a bit, friendly guy, good suggestions on the whiskey
    		â Grabbed my puffy and a book and did a tasting flight
    		â Free chocolates!!! Whaddup
    		â Rather than buying at the bar, went in to the shop
    		â Standing in line, loved the smell next to the distillery, mixture of salt water and malt. Fantastic
    		â Snagged a bottle and had a really friendly chat with thr cashier. Super bubbly and nice
    	â¢ Took a few pics in town as it started to rain and then hit the road and off we went
    	â¢ Took the road back to the main road and headed north toward dunvegan
    	â¢ Was getting hungry, and spotted a seafood food truck in dunvegan. Zeroed in and here we go
    	â¢ Of course, was closed. Wasnât even sure if it existedâ¦
    	â¢ Torn, didnât want to look up food options, and since the weather was decent I decided to drive out to another end of the road and venture over there
    	â¢ Turns out, yet again, the best decision
    	â¢ Headed over to Neist Point, essentially because there was a lighthouse, but also way much more
    	â¢ The Drive in opened my eyes to some huge cliffs right on the water, I got excited!!! Parked, smashed a bagel down my throat, and was on the hunt for tranquility
    	â¢ Found a spot in the cow pasture overlooking thr water. Got to enjoy it for a bit before some douchebag with a drone ruined it
    		â I HATE drones in nature. It completely kills the vibe
    		â Just like asshats who bring speakers on a hike
    		â Sure, must be fun and enjoyable for you, but canât you see that that shitty noise and thing is pretty ducking annoying
    		â Background - for me when Iâm in nature or around something nature, I want it to be just that - nature. As little or No human influence or trace whatsoever. Thatâs what I strive for whenever I find a spot to post up and take it all in. Nothing but natural sights, natural sounds, and natural things to sense in every way. So when people start throwing drones and music and god knows what else around, it kills it for me and pisses me off (probably more than it should, but here we areâ¦)
    	â¢ Got up and motored on, and got onto the trail to head down to the tower and lighthouse and such
    	â¢ Man, there kept being more and more to this place!
    	â¢ Wandered up the big hill and enjoyed the views, great in all directions
    	â¢ Then headed down and over the next bump and wandered over to an old crane that was decommissioned. Cool to see the layers of rust and how, assuming my due to proximity to the sea, the steel was literally just flaking away
    	â¢ From there, wandered down the jetty and found my solitude. Beautiful views, wind blowing, watching seagulls dive bomb the water, the kelp ebbing and flowing. Peaceful. Gorgeous
    	â¢ Eventually motored over to the lighthouse, checked it out, then made my way back up
    	â¢ Hard being in a place like that where you never lose sight of the sights, walking is hard because I donât want to watch where Iâm going
    	â¢ Back to the car, a few more deep breaths and deep stares, and on the road
    	â¢ Back to Dunvegan, and needed to eat. Stopped at a place called The Old School, likely because it was the old school building
    	â¢ No spots inside, so ordered up, grabbed my beer and water, and out to the patio
    	â¢ Started to drizzle, and there were some midges about, but I was relaxing
    	â¢ Food was up! Snagged it and holy shit deliciousness
    	â¢ Scallops with chorizo over cous cous. Zomfg, that with a blue cheese salad. Fucking yummy!!!
    	â¢ Enjoyed the hell out of that meal, was definitely in my food happynzone doing my food happy dance
    	â¢ From there, motored on and wanted to go see a recommendation, a memorial cairn for a piping clan. Drove down to the end of the road to where the trail starts, but at the start of the trail there were no parking signs everywhereâ¦ hemmed and hawed, wanted to check it out, but dusk was coming quick and I was tired. Vetoed it and motored on towards Portree
    	â¢ First stop, coop. Stocked up on some grub and then headed towards Storr to find a campsite
    	â¢ Finding a place to park and sleep is a lot harder when itâs dark out. And the fact that I usually get to that point in my day so much later than others doesnât make it easy
    	â¢ Back and forth, but found a spot anf hit the sack

    2021.09.12
    	â¢ Another not so great nightâs sleep, but up and at em to try and beat the tourist rush to Storr
    	â¢ Packed and organized, then drove over. Toyed with just staying parked and hiking over to save the dough, but figured I can penny punch elsewhere, and the parking fee is a baseline contribution to support me being able to enjoy nature and such
    	â¢ It was still rainy and cloudy at the top when I rolled up; so ended up making breakfast in the car to pass the time
    	â¢ Also shaved in the bathroom, as I was way overdue for that
    	â¢ Eventually, geared up and started the hike
    	â¢ All uphill to get to the main attractions, but once there, and wonderful potpourri and free for all!!!
    	â¢ Old Man of Storr, a collection of giant rock faces and some unique pillars/features, with trails zigzagginfnandnwinding through all of it
    	â¢ Thankfully, as and by the time I was up there, the rain died down and it all became clear to see!!! Hot damn!!!
    	â¢ Coire Faoin - incredible amphitheater below the highest point, just listening to the wind dance across the grass. Lovely sound and display
    	â¢ Coire Scamadal - incredible amphitheater on the other side of the area. The smell and feel of the fresh air while sitting there wasninvigorating. Very tempted to up and down the hike all the way to Quiraing. But saw it was a 12miler and wasnât prepped for that: really want to do that all next time though

    2021.09.13
    	â¢ A
    	â¢ Hiking Ben Alligin, had TIâs The Good Life stuck in my head. Damn itâs true for me. I bitch and complain about so much, but Iâve got a damn good life and I am blessed beyond belief

    2021.09.14
    	â¢ Woke up, didnât sleep bad but not great
    	â¢ Fucking midges weâre out in full force, so I tried to do everything without getting out of the car. Had to get out to heat up water, hit thankfully survived
    	â¢ Made my oatmeal and some coffee, and just stayed in my pjs as I hit the road
    	â¢ First stop - SHOWER
    	â¢ Finally, first in a week. Felt so damn nasty dirty and grimy
    	â¢ Skimped one from thr torridon public toilets, stupidly forgot to donate money after showering and filling up my water, but what a lifesaver
    	â¢ As I loaded up thr car, I walked over to the field across the lot to take pictures of the sign and mountains, just looked like a gorgeous framing
    	â¢ Holy Batman, saw two elk, male and female, prancing across the field a ways off!!! Damnit, had the wrong lens on
    	â¢ Luck would have it, instead of prancing away, they started coming closer!!! Got to about 100â away, before the male went left and female followed, quite thr gathering of folks watching. But gorgeous!!! Really dark coats. Neature, love it
    	â¢ Enjoyed that, then hit thr road
    	â¢ What. A. Drive.
    	â¢ Calm, low key, gorgeous mountain sights
    	â¢ Was in a very low key and relaxed mood, just really enjoying thr drive and stopping often to take pictures and breathe it in
    	â¢ Slowly got into Kinlochewe and initial plan was to turn right towards Inverness. But thr adventure bug talked sense into me and I turned left, time for an extended loop around. Love me some freedom in adventuring :-)
    	â¢ Shortly thereafter got to a trail center right on the water. Got out and snagged a spot on the shore of a rock chair. Got comfy and enjoyed the time watching thr mountains and taking it all in. Peaceful, gorgeous. Reading the signs; the mountain across used to be 5km tall, now about 1km. I know it was ages ago, but that seems far fetchedâ¦
    	â¢ After the Ben Alligin hike, I told myself today was going to be a low key (ie no hiking or biking) day, and despite the lure of thr trail from thr trail center, I held to that. Back on the road
    	â¢ Shortly after leaving there, a wee bit of rain hit the world. In thr car, thankfully, so beautiful
    	â¢ Got to Gairloch and pulled in. Thought about pottery, and how Iâd seen some pottery stores on skye and throughout thr drive, and remembered my broken favorite mug :-( searched and saw a pottery studio in Ullapool, put that on the map for a target

    	â¢ Mark the Brit at one of the viewpoints, random conversation started by asking how I got here from Germany and learned that heâs a former trucker waiting on trace to Brazil to be possible so he can get back to his farm down there. He was astounded at how quiet and calm and gorgeous Scotland/The Highlands are. And damn itâs truly amazing how you can find peace and quiet here like nowhere elseâ¦
    	â¢ A
    	â¢ Sitting having my beers in Newtonmore, two blokes sitting behind me. Probably you-mid 20s, military (I think navy, but weâre not near the water), talking about fighting and air friers. Proper funny to listen in

    2021.09.15
    	â¢ Easy up and at em. Got Rupert rearranged then headed to thr trail center
    	â¢ Epitome of a relaxing start. Got there, made my oatmeal and a coffee, and sat and read my book. What a delight :-)
    	â¢ Up the hill to start, damn climbing rock gardens
    	â¢ Couple guys chatting at the top, joined in for a bit
    	â¢ Down, kinda. Too much uphill pedaling during the down part of thr trail
    	â¢ Would be the theme of thr whole place. That and no berms on sharp corners
    	â¢ The one part of thr trail that was really fun was the last few hundred feet of the red. An actual berm and flow.
    	â¢ Plenty of good, fun, technical, rocky sections, but too many uphills in between
    	â¢ Back to the car for lunch after EFI
    	â¢ Chowed on some delicious Serbian Reis pot, again, relaxing
    	â¢ Got approached by Sebastian the german living in Scotland. Needed tape and we had a chat. Between jobs so driving and biking around thr further from home trails. Likely see him at Conroe tomorrow
    	â¢ Then in line for thr loo chatted with a motorcyclist with his crew journeying around Scotland for the week. Super friendly dude
    	â¢ Then chatted with Steve the scot and got some more recommendations
    		â Aberfeldy, especially top of the world
    		â Golfie, on the other side of the river from Innerleithan
    		â Torridon Loop
    		â McMaster Rider, Scottish you river
    	â¢ Went to hit the unsanctioned trails. Hell of a pedal up at the end, pushed most of the way
    	â¢ At the top of the hill, some kind of old fort. Checked it out, didnât seem like an old fort, just a giant rock outcropping. Beautiful spot though
    	â¢ Sick, ready, jumped on my bike ready to ride, some kind of grinding sound
    	â¢ Knew it was the mudguard, but couldnât figure out how it got so misshapen
    	â¢ Tried to bend it back, nothing working, STR
    	â¢ Then I saw it. Fuck. Fuck me. Fuck my life. Broken seat stay. Commence all levels of sadness
    	â¢ Walked my bike down the hill, down what wouldâve been the best trail of the day. Youâve got to be kidding meâ¦.
    	â¢ Back at the car, not sure what to do with myself and my life and my trip
    	â¢ Next few days weâre all biking, thatâs shot.
    	â¢ Felt completely lost and adrift
    	â¢ Slowly pieced things together, or tried to
    	â¢ Booked a whiskey tasting for the morrow, and got changed to let my clothes air out
    	â¢ Started doing some research on bike replacement, because now itâs an emergency. No chance at saving her this time without some kind of miracle :-(
    	â¢ Then Sebastian from earlier rolled in. Showed him the sadness, then we went and grabbed a coffee
    		â Heâs been living in Scotland for a good five years now, between jobs
    		â Agreed that living in a country with friendly people is such a nice thing
    		â Harris Gin
    		â Interesting to hear how the NHS, Uks health system, is financially controlled separately by region
    		â Scotland similar to New Zealand in a good few ways - progressive, small, in a good spot
    		â Interesting to hear more background on the independence referendum. Now that theyâre already out of the eu, interesting to see the timeline and affect on the next referendum
    		â Such a beautiful country
    		â Told me about tweed love, big demo event in Perbles near Innerleithen this weekend - aka a chance at still riding with a demo bike!
    		â Had a lovely chat with him
    	â¢ Filled up water, then kinda bummed in my camp chair trying to figure out what to do. Felt so down and aimless and lost (dramatic but true)
    	â¢ Eventually pulled off my bike pedals for Saturday, sent some emails, and spent a ton of time looking for where to go eat
    	â¢ Ended up back at the place from last night
    		â Beer was the highlight
    		â Weird tomato soup and the chicken was dry
    		â Got a lot of reading in, just getting juicy in the book
    	â¢ Then off to sleep the day off
    	â¢ Found a nice lay y near the previous night
    	â¢ Went and sat by the water for a bit, but damn midges ruin everything

    	â¢ Blair athol

    	â¢ Lovey evening with Derek and Susan. Such welcoming and generous hosts. Derek had some great beers to share, Susan cooked up a delicious fish pie, and Angus their English terrier was as friendly and chill as can be!

    <h3>Musical Realizations</h3>

    <p>This doesn't really have anything directly to do with memories, per-se, but while I was writing up this post and my post about going home, I somehow got onto Mac Miller and had his tunes (most of his new stuff) giving me some good vibes while I was writing things up.</p>

    <p>Well, during a mental break I looked him up and realized he's dead. Died in 2018 due to a drug overdose. Which, as I put 2 and 2 together, one of the albums I was listening to (Circles) was a posthumous release. That kinda shocked me a bit. Good music, and from someone who put out a ton and had enough stored up for a release after he was gone.</p>

    <p>Not sure where I'm going with this, but it was a bit of a weird realization.</p>
