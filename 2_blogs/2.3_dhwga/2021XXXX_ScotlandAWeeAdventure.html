    <p>This trip had been on my mind for quite a while. Last summer, this was the main thing I wanted to do, but with COVID raging through Europe and borders still closed, that just wasn't an option.</p>

    <p>Keeping an eye on the news while I was home, I saw at the start of August that Scotland and the UK changed up their travel requirements - if you were vaccinated you no longer needed to quarantine for 14 days. BOOM BABY!!! I was in business!!! As soon as I figured that out, I knew my plans were on and I had a nice little adventure to look forward to.</p>

    <p>A Road Trip through Scotland with Three Trip Pillars:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mountain Biking</li>
      <li>Backpacking and Hiking</li>
      <li>Whiskey Drinking</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All I wanted to do, and hot-diggity-damn was I in for a treat!!!</p>

    <h2 id="TurbulentTurnaround">A Turbulent Turnaround</h2>

    <p>After landing in Stuttgart, returning from my wonderful trip back home, I was ready to hit the ground running and head straight off to my next adventure! The plan was to land, pick up some bike parts, do laundry that night, pack the car, and the next day head out on the road with Rupert, my bike, and three weeks of adventuring in Scotland! Welp, Delta and KLM sure had something to say about that.</p>

    <p>Getting to baggage claim I waited, waited, and waited some more, until the turnstile stopped and neither of my bags showed up. Quite the unique little wrench the universe handed me. I was ready to just sit there and wait until the next plane came with (hopefully) my bags, but got in touch with KLM and hit the road.</p>

    <p>First stop was in Tübingen to pick up my bike parts. As soon as I got home, I set to getting my Patrol back up and running. At least I could get that squared away and ready for the trip. But for the rest of it, I kinda needed my biking, hiking, and adventuring gear. And since my biking, hiking, and adventuring gear were in two suitcases somewhere in the hands of KLM, I was kinda put on ice.</p>

    <p>Thanks to jet-lag, I had a bit of an early night. I be-bopped around the house to get a few things done, take care of a couple small tasks, but since I couldn't do laundry to really get things done, I called it a day.</p>

    <p>That next day, I was itching to get going, but KLM was nothing but slow to the punch. Well, long story short, the minute I left the house in the afternoon to go run and get something, that was the exact minute the guy showed up with the suitcases. Thankfully though, they arrived intact and now the real trip prep began!</p>

    <p>I briefly toyed with trying to get everything done and leave that night, but opted for the more relaxed route (I was on vacation dammit!) and had that night to get prepped and ready to go. Laundry at the laundromat, groceries and snacks from Kaufland, and slowly but surely figuring out all that I needed to bring with me for the adventures at hand.</p>

    <p>Along with that trip prep, I did the logistical trip prep of figuring out what the actual limitations/rules were for entry. Although I was vaccinated, I still had to do a PCR test within two days of arrival, so I did my best to figure where in the hell that was possible. Eventually I got all the logistics squared away, including booking my train ticket the next day, my bags were packed, and I was ready for one helluvan adventure!!!</p>

    <h2 id="OffWeGo">Off We GOOO!!!</h2>

    <a class="body_ctr" href="https://www.polarsteps.com/NialTilson/4256404-scotland?s=FEBA20E7-4C37-4DEB-9BF5-18DAD2CE6FC5">Spark Notes - My Polarsteps Journey</a>

    <p>After a good night's rest, it was time to load up and GTFO. I made a nice breakfast, packed all my snacks, got all my stuff in the car, and then Rupert and I were ready to go!!!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/01wJYJGh.jpg" alt="Rupert packed and Ready"></img>

    <p>The most direct route to Calais was through France, but France has some pretty high tolls which I wasn't looking to pay. Thankfully, the route through Luxembourg and Belgium dropped me right into the Northeast corner of France to skipp all the tolls. Hot damn!</p>

    <p>The early start got me out on the road on a grey, cloudy, and rainy day. I had a train departure on the Chunnel (!!!) all set, and a PCR test reserved shortly after I was set to arrive in Great Britain. Although it was a bit flexible, I had a goal and timeline to hit for the ~7 hour drive. So I jumped in the car, turned on <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantaram_(novel)">Shantaram</a> audio book (thanks for the recommendation Dawn!), and I was off!</p>

    <p>I had on-and-off rain teh whole way. But with fairly empty roads, the drive kept rolling along fairly easily. I had soon enough passed through Luxembourg, then Belgium, and after filling up on gas, air, and a snack break, I was headed into France! From the border it was just a short hop, skip, and a jump down the highway, and I was pulling up the Chunnel (aka Eurotunnel, its official name)!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0IYNdUOh.jpg" alt="Rainy Roadway"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7PKVJzxh.jpg" alt="Entering Luxembourg"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fhed65ih.jpg" alt="Entering Belgium"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/V3rEjlah.jpg" alt="Entering the Chunnel!"></img>

    <p>It being such a revolutionary bit of infrastructure the world over, I was extremely stoked to get the chance to experience the Chunnel! Yes, it's officially called the Eurotunnel, but that name is boring and too stiff. My time was booked for a ride across the channel, but I actually arrived a little early and got a spot on the earlier train. Lovin it!</p>

    <p>As i rolled in an d checked in, I had just enough time to run into the giant welcome center, use the facilities, snag a power adapter, and then my group was being called into line. And with that, it was time to get going!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/oJFZUNjh.jpg" alt="Rupert Resting before the Chunnel"></img>

    <p>Well, if I'd have taken my trip a year or two before, i have a feeling the whole process would've been a little less complicated. But with that ridiculous thing known as Brexit, things are a bit different. So as I jumped into the line to get loaded on, I had a bit of a process to get through.</p>

    <p>From the giant parking lot at the welcoming center, once you see your train/group/number on your ticket on the giant board, you hope in your car and join the line (<em>queue</em>). At first you kinda curve around, and then someone verifies you can enter the giant fenced off where things get real.</p>

    <p>The two lines of cars opened up to about 10 lanes, and first step was the French Customs checkpoint. Easy enough, quick chat with the guy, then pulled off to the next stop. British Customs checkpoint, also simple enough. This time surprised with some English, but made it through that. All along the way were bunches of sensors and xray things, but the funnel of checkpoints and such was complete, and then I got funneled through to the actual waiting area. Kinda like a ferry, I just had to sit and wait.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/d42klFEh.jpg" alt="Tiny Roundabout"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/6eAMsWeh.jpg" alt="UK Border Checkpoint"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/WaNFPCzh.jpg" alt="Lots of Waiting"></img>

    <p>After a good 10-20 minutes of standing around in the hazy sunlight, looking at the gigantic complex and all the stuff going on, my line of cars was on the move - time to load up! The waiting area was right next to the train tracks, so after getting on the move, we were led onto a big bridge that spanned the (what seemed like 20) train tracks in the area. But the bridge had ramps that led down to the gaps in between each track, and our group was shuttled down one of those. Once we came to track level, there was an open train car waiting for us, and in we go!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BJxIxxVh.jpg" alt="Gate onto the Bridge"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0RczQsAh.jpg" alt="Train Area"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/8ILxWHIh.jpg" alt="The Belly of the Beast"></img>

    <p>Once onto the train car, we were all ushered forward until we were either butt-up against the car in front of us, or at the start of a new train car. For me, I got the start of the new car bit, and once I parked, it was a matter of waiting until we got going. That sign came once the doors between the train cars got shut. We were on our way! (Can you tell I was pretty excited for this whole thing!?)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bDj5p2Bh.jpg" alt="Start the Doors"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hQB8TCDh.jpg" alt="View Forward..."></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hQB8TCDh.jpg" alt="...is Closing"></img>

    <p>Parked, train doors shut, and just kinda waiting, I didn't even realize once the train started moving! Made sense, because all I had to look out of from the car was the giant monolithic train car, with only a tiny little porthole within view to the outside world.</p>

    <p>The ride was actually quite smooth. But since I didn't have anything to look at (and wouldn't have even if there were bigger windows, we were going through a tunnel under the sea by the way...), I decided a nap was in store. We were only supposed to need about 35 minutes to cross the channel, so that was some perfect timing if you ask me.</p>

    <p>Naps, always the right answer. After I woke up, I still had a little time until the trip would come to completion. As I was heading into a foreign land and foreign world, where the driving would be something different than I know, I took after some recommendations and put myself some reminders together to help keep me on track on the wrong side of the road.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VA9aArmh.jpg" alt="Drive on the LEFT"></img>

    <p>All of a sudden, there was light coming out of the porthole, I was officially on Britsh soil! Quite a pretty cool, and altogether quick and seamless, way of getting there! We stopped, the doors between the train cars opened up, and after a bit of waiting, we were let loose and let the games begin!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/P86IWTPh.jpg" alt="Porthole to British Soil"></img><br>

    <p>As soon as I was out and back in daylight and on dry pavement, I snapped into gear. As I said, I was now driving with left-hand traffic, and it was an immediate entrance to a different world. Mental reminders to constantly stay to the left started, I maneuvered out of the giant complex, and I was jumping on the highway (<em>motorway</em>) to start heading north. Off we go!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bGjJJ9vh.jpg" alt="Left-Hand Traffic"></img>

    <h2 id="Day1-Drive">Heading North</h2>

    <p>After I was unleashed onto British Soil, as I said, I had a PCR Test to take. On the way, I pulled off a Motorway rest stop to fill up on gas (shit's expensive yo), and popped in to use the bathroom (<em>loo</em>), and had my first kinda shock/surprise. Ritter Sport is a German chocolate, something I get fairly regularly. But seeing the Rum Traube Nuss version in English was a very vivid double take for me - I was in a foreign place.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ArzixABh.jpg" alt="Rum Raisin Hazelnut"></img>

    <p>My PCR appointment had me take a B-line over towards Gatwick Airport (south of London). Google Maps took that pretty literally and had me take some country roads to get there. Normally I'm not a fan of that, as I'd rather take the fast roads to get there, but this was a delightful little detour that led to something fun.</p>

    <p>As I learned very quickly, which held throughout Britain and Scotland, once you get off the motorway, streets can get really thin. Hedges, fences, parked cars, there's not a lot of space to squeeze your car over the road. But, despite the toothpick wide lanes (honestly, not too much different than the tight alleyways in Germany, but just an adjustment for me being on the wrong side of the road), I cruised past the various countryside accoutrement of the UK. Oh Look!!! A Double Decker Bus!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Isi5hHLh.jpg" alt="Double Decker Delivery"></img>

    <p>Once I got to the parking lot-turned test center, I had a fairly easy time of it. Got in, checked in, stayed in my car as they probed my nose, and in the blink of an eye I was finally set free to start my first big trip in a year. But first I had to get out of the place. It's hard to enter the code at the gate when the display is on the right side of the vehicle, and I'm on the left...</p>

    <p>But thankfully someone was right out in front of me, and I was able to sneak behind them and get out. Now, finally off and running, I decided to double back along the country roads I'd taken on the way in to go see something that piqued my interest.</p>

    <p>After thinking I took a wrong turn and pulling into the wrong side of the parking lot entrance (oops!), I reoriented and got myself on the correct direction. Shortly thereafter I found myself at a little clubhouse with a sprawling semi-kept lawn. Time to watch some cricket! :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lI9GwXPh.jpg" alt="Cricket Pitch"></img>

    <p>I don't know how I got turned on to cricket, but I'm a huge fan of it. Never been to a game, still don't know all the rules in-depth, but I have always been fascinated by the sport.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">To be honest, I find cricket more of a sport than baseball...</p>

    <p>I pullled up and put my 'dinner' together and was able to find a bench next to the pitch to post up and watch. What a perfect little way to go! A cozy bench, some local folks practicing some cricket, and a relaxing evening to get my first taste of British culture.</p>

    <p>It seemed to me that this was a local clubhouse (likely similar to the German Verein setup), with a bunch of folks out for some practice on a Saturday night. There were some folks by the clubhouse with some drinks, there was a little scoreboard over there, and it looked like I stumbled upon a little slice of life in the neighborhood. How delightful!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ji2bBtdh.jpg" alt="The Union Jack"></img>

    <p>Relaxing, delicious, somewhat-insightful, low-key, and overall enjoyable. Really glad my eyes werw scanning on the drive to the test center, and LOVE the inherent flexibility of solo-adventuring. The practice didn't last all too long, but I was able to sit, eat, and watch a little bit of such an intriguing sport.</p>

    <div class="quickhit">
      <p>As I was sitting there, I realized how much I've been able to enjoy Sports connected to the cultures of the various places I've traveled. I'm a huge fan of traveling, and sports, and being able to combine and experience them both has been an insightful blast around every turn. To kinda recap, here's what I mean here:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sumo Wrestling in Japan</li>
        <li>Baseball in Cuba</li>
        <li>Hockey in Russia</li>
        <li>Soccer/Fußball in Germany</li>
      </ul>

      <p>That's a pretty cool list, but a few others are still in my head that I'm looking to experience at some point in my life. Cricket in India or a number of other countries (would love to go to a full-day test with a crew of fun folks), Rugby in New Zealand (bummed I wasn't able to do that when I was there a couple years ago), and a couple more yet to come!</p>
    </div>

    <p>After their practice wrapped up, it was time for me to hit the road. At that point, I still had about a 6-7 hour drive to get to the border of Scotland. Since it was late in the day, and I wasn't feeling like pushing it, I knew I wasn't going to get it all that night. Despite that, I hit the road and knew I could get a couple more hours out of the way before knocking off for the night.</p>

    <p>With my audio book keeping me going, I used the trip to get more and more used to driving on the wrong side of the road. The day slowly crept forward towards a beautiful sunset over the road. With the sun down, I kept pushing a bit further, but ended up looking for parks or some potential places where I could park in relative peace for the night.</p>

    <p>That search put me onto a park right next to the motorway with a decent looking parking lot, so I re-routed and headed towards some sleep. Got off the highway, headed through a town and took a right, and then right before the park I saw what looked like a little pub. Being in Britain, pub culture being a big thing, knowing I was on an adventure, I knew I had to stop in for a little night cap.</p>

    <p>Turned out to be a money decision. It turned out to be a little Inn, and there was a wedding going on out back, but the cozy little pub was open for enjoyment. I popped in and had a friendly chat witht he folks behind the bar to help me decide what I was in the mood for. Some friendly banter, learning that Britain didn't have a mask mandate, and settling on my goods, I was ready to relax.</p>

    <p>Quite the perfect place to relax after a full day of driving. Soon enough, my cask stout arrived, and then the piéce de résistance - a lava brownie. Got DAMN I love me some brownies. Being able to enjoy them in a big cozy chair in a comfy, cozy room with tons of old-timey pictures and posters and such. What a delight!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cH04Qm8h.jpg" alt="Stout and Taps"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/TuewzDgh.jpg" alt="Stout and Brownie"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/9UkPI8gh.jpg" alt="The Former British Empire"></img>

    <p>The Black Hound Stout was smooth, the lava brownie was delectable, and it was the perfect spot to whet the tongue and finish off the day. I wrapped up the deliciousness, jumped back in Rupert and motored over to the park nearby. Once there, I found an empty spot and started the first of many nights of re-organizing Rupert and building up my bed before knocking out for the evening. Being back on the road, back on adventure, damn it was refreshing.</p>

    <h2 id="Day2-StartingOff">Day 2 - Starting Off in Scotland</h2>

    <p>Once I woke up, I really didn't want to go anywhere. Knowing I was on vacation, I all the time in the world. On the one hand, I had an incredible adventure ahead of me, but on the other, knowing I could sleep and be lazy for as long as I wanted, it was tempting. All said and done, I rolled around for a lot longer than I thought, but eventually got in gear, re-packed Rupert, and hit the road.</p>

    <p>As I started out, I needed to fill up on water. The two gas stations I stopped at didn't have any water fountains (and I wasn't in the mood for paying for water), so I was a bit out of luck. Next, I figured I'd stop and find some breakfast, but the one place I stopped at should have been open, but the metal shutters across the storefront said otherwise. Not wanting to waste much more time, I made the executive decision to hit the road and head north.</p>

    <p>The drive started out with a beautiful morning through blue skies and sunshine. But once the motorway weaved up through the Lakes district through, the landcape and the weather started to change. Grey skies with tons of rolling hills, the drive was quite enjoyable and left me wishing I had more time for some stopping and exploration through that assumedly gorgeous region.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/V08USWjh.jpg" alt="Sunny Skies and Open Roads"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/OLI8Z1kh.jpg" alt="Lakes and Hills"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/DxhK70wh.jpg" alt="Hills"></img>

    <p>The further north I got, the more rural it got, with tons of sheep and stone fences all over the place. This was a trend that would stick the whole trip. But with those aspects prevalent on the road, it sure made me feel like I was in the UK. Soon enough though, I'd officially crossed into Scotland!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/1AjlAp3h.jpg" alt="Welcome to Scotland!"></img>

    <p>Shortly after crossing over, I was off the motorway and starting my adventure in Scotland. I'd been looking forward to this adventure for such a long time and stoked to actually be there and getting it started! The first stop of this grand ride was one of the three Trip Pillars - Mountain Biking. But as the first first thing, I had to get some food and water in me.</p>

    <p>After stopping at Starbucks to fill up my thermos with coffee and fill up on water (the folks there were surprised by my non-scottish accent), I googled and found a good breakfast spot in Pat's Patio and headed over. Once I got there I thought I was in the wrong place, but after realising I had to walk through the nursery and plants, I waltzed into the cafe, orderd me some breakfast, and was surprised by the beautiful patio in the back. A camera phone can't do it justice, but my first taste of Scottish nature, in the hay fields, trees, hills, and calmness in all of it, was a great start to the nature-side of the trip!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CUP4kysh.jpg" alt="Scottish Countryside"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/dKuPtKNh.jpg" alt="Coffee at Pat's"></img>

    <p>Pat's gave me a great start to the day in some delicious pancakes and coffee as I did a little research for the days ahead. From Pat's though, it was an easy drive over to the trailhead for the first stop at 7 Stanes - Ae.</p>

    <p>In reasearching the various destinations for mountain biking in Scotland, 7 Stanes came up pretty often. It's a group of trail networks spread throughout southern Scotland, and came with some good reviews, so I was pumped to get started. Unfortunately, I didn't have money on me, so I went in to the cafe (how cool!) that was right next to the bike shop (WhAT?!?) in the parking lot, snagged a milky way to make change, and then went back to the car to get ready to ride!</p>

    <p>After setting out, there was a weird grinding sound in the rear brakes, so I 180'd real quick to go fix that. Adjusted the caliper location, pulled out the pads, pressed in the pistons, and after that it was good to go. Second try was the charm here, and soon I was on the trail headed up to the top!</p>

    <p>Up we go! Kinda. It was not super straightforward where to go, but I took the first forest road and we were on the way. It was a bit of a pedal, but soon enough I made it to the top top and took a minute to enjoy the views. Nothing like getting a beauty bike shot.</p>

    <p>Now, Down we go! To start, I got in a couple runs on the orange lines. I was expecting some intense features and fun stuff, but aside from only a couple things that I had to roll around, the trails were all pretty tame. I rode over to another trail, gave it a go and enjoyed the rocky but fun ride.</p>

    <p>After a bit of riding, I realized how a lot of the trails were really short. Then after some more riding, I got the feeling that the downhill trails that were there were a bit of an exception in the southwest highlands. As I'd learn through the next couple days, most places have tours mapped out, longer XC routes. That is not the kind of riding I'm a big fan on, and was not what I thought I would be riding.</p>

    <p>I got some more riding in and had a few chats with some other riders as I was gearing up for another run. Friendly folks, and they talked about their big loop around the tour trail. With one more run down Shredder and then Omega Man, and then decided to call it a day. Overall, fairly good stuff with a couple drops, bunches of rocks (that would be common throughout ALL rides), some techn and a few other things. To be honest, it was an ok first ride in Scotland, and not as exciting/dynamic/intense as I was expecting. Oh well, more to come!</p>

    <p>Back at the car, the parking lot was nearly empty. With the quietness I lazily put all my bike stuff away, got changed, filled up on water, and then did some trip research while leachign off wifi from the cafe there. Noice. Following that - nap time. :-)</p>

    <p>Once I was awake and ready to roll, I left the trailhead and motored on over to Dumfries, the big town in the area. The plan was to cruise through town and find somewhere to eat. I researched a couple restaurants and after running into a few that were closed (ended up being a common occurrence), I ended up at Crumb.</p>

    <p>Entering a restaurant on your own is almost always a bit weird. Shaking off that entrance I got in, seated, and got myself a Glenkinchie 12-yr to start off the culinary tour of Scotland.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3uekcz9h.jpg" alt="Glenkinchie"></img>

    <p>While waiting for my meal, there was a birthday girl at the other table who was really shy. They brought out a cake with some candles on it, and it seemed like she did not want to be there. But, soon enough, my food was out and time to feast. Holy shit that sea bass was delicious! A lemony taste off the grill gave it some bright taste and went well with some shrmp. Fucking goooooood...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/PCitv23h.jpg" alt="Seabass and Capers"></img>

    <p>After dinner I headed back to Rupert and reached a mood that would occur every so often during the trip where I was just unsure what to do. After a bit of hemming and hawing, I decided to grab the camera and head off on a walk through the town of Dumfries.</p>

    <p>It's not a huge town, and with Covid still on everyone's minds, it was weird with how quiet and empty the walk through town was. Despite all that, it was nice little loop through town on a quiet Sunday night.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iwVuhy0h.jpg" alt="A Quiet Dumfries Street"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZwHsM9th.jpg" alt="Pedestrian Alley"></img>

    <p>On my stroll I made a nice loop through the center of town, and out to the river. I got a good vibe of the buildings and the town, then enjoyed my walk along the river. Some ducks, some townsfolk, some clouds, and a relaxed walk really made it a nice stroll. After rounding the trail back towards town, I headed back to Rupert with the plan for getting out of town and finding a place to sleep.</p>

    <p>Getting out of town, I was just looking for a quiet road with enough space to park. As I'd learn, there's a pretty prevalent setup in Scotland with small essentially rest stops all over the place along highways. I was headed in the direction of one place, but stumbled upon one-such rest stop on the way, so I parked, reshuffled Rupert, and hit the sack.</p>

    <h2 id="Day3-Stones">Day 3 - Stone Castles and Stone Rolls</h2>

    <p>I slept. A ton. I didn't realize I could get 12 hours of sleep in an not-so-ideal sleep setup in Rupert, but it happened. I rolled around more than I liked, but it was a wonderful night's sleep. After waking up, I had a lazy up-and-at-'em, and started the day with an apple and PB&J croissant with a few onlookers.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lrgejywh.jpg" alt="Farmer Tree"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UFTQRkGh.jpg" alt="Muted Colorful Countryside"></img>

    <p>Initally I'd planned to continue the mountain biking at Mabie Forest. But after taking a look at what was there, it looked to be just a small jumpled and I doubted the of the trails based on what I'd ridden the day before. So I audibled and changed up the plan and was off to see a castle!</p>

    <p>I parked a little outside of the area, thankfully remembering I had a tall bike on the roof and wasn't sure I would make it through the archway. But I parked and then walked on down to Caerlaverock Castle.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UuyzTOJh.jpg" alt="Roadway In"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xIUEFGUh.jpg" alt="The Short Arch"></img>

    <p>Along with the unique name, <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerlaverock_Castle">Caerlaverock Castle</a> is quite the unique castle. It's in the middle of a fairly big moat, and has a triangular shape growing from the main gate. I walked across the grass field directly in front of the castle and could admire the various shaded red brick all covered with moss, algae, and lichen. Unfortunately, the inside of the castle was closed due to the danger of falling rock, but I started a loop around the moat.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5eKcb8th.jpg" alt="Caerlaverock from Afar"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fFhJggmh.jpg" alt="Castle and Bridge"></img>

    <p>Although the inside of the castle was closed, that didn't mean I wasn't able to explore it. At the entrance gate, there was a QR code that led to a 3-D Model of the castle! In that model, you could scroll around the digital representation of the structure, and even some of the physical info signs inside were in enough detail to be able to read and learn from. How cool!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SWukshth.jpg" alt="Corner Moat"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/mbBHAYeh.jpg" alt="Rear Corner View"></img>

    <p>Around the back side of the castle, as I was sitting down on the grass trying to read a sign on the model, a lady behind me asked me to move. I was sitting there, there was a wide open knoll to either side of me, but for some reason I was in the way. I got really irked by this. All she had to do was take a couple steps to the side in either direction to get me out of view (you know, that's kinda how field of view works), but insisted on standing there and making me move. That pissed me off more than it should’ve, but I stupidly obliged despite my frustration.</p>

    <p>Idiots aside, it was a cool little walk around the castle. Definitely a weird setup with the whole back of it being wide open (likely wasn't that way way back when...), but it added to the overall uniqueness of the place.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/NPoyGoJh.jpg" alt="Main Castle House"></img><br>

    <p>With my walk around the castle I walked up to the little info center and learned that I'd just walked around the "new" castle. Although it was built in the 13th Century, ther were ruins of an even older castle (the "old" castle) on the same grounds just a short walk through the woods away.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/pYapUvah.jpg" alt="Sign of the Castle Grounds"></img>

    <p>Naturally, once I knew about it, I had to go check it out. The walk through the woods was short but pretty as I made my way to the "old" castle. Turns out, it was essentially just the floor plan of what was the old castle after archaeological excavations and clean up work. It was kinda crazy to see just how small it was. I couldn't imagine having any kind of biggish gatherings there.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/NC4e39Gh.jpg" alt="Old Castle Sign"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/NpceStgh.jpg" alt="Old Banquet Hall"></img>

    <p>I was enjoying the calm, grey morning and did a little walking out to a nearby pasture before heading back to the new castle. Once there, I found myself a bench to sit and castle- and people-watch. Turns out, it's hard to eavesdrop on British and Scottish accents. I enjoyed the nice little break and taking in the castle for a bit more, before heading back to Rupert and continuing the adventure.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SoB87exh.jpg" alt="Rupert at the Ready"></img>

    <p>From the castle, I stopped off real quick to fill up on gas, and then was off to Dalbeattie. Ready for another bike ride, I got parked, situated, and me and my Patrol were once again ready to ride.</p>

    <p>One of the dudes that I talked to at Ae recommended this place, almost solely because of one thing - The Slab. This seemed like one heckuva feature, so I was stoked to go check this out and was excited at the prospect of some more downhill-/enduro-type trails. At least that's what it seemed like from the Trailforks map.</p>

    <p>The ride in was fairly straightforward, and I was able to check out one black run (it was not a black), then head up to the red for the lookout (there wasn't really a lookout), then I pointed my ride towards The Slab.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/TcFV0NIh.jpg" alt="Forest Roadway"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/s2rmYTHh.jpg" alt="Dalbeatte Heart"></img>

    <p>It was more XC trail to get there, but I finally reached The Slab. Turns out, it was a little smaller than I imagined. Despite that, it was still a gigantic slab/ramp of rock. Pretty impressive and unique. There were some folks there when I rolled up, but I took a quick look and got a good ride in. Fun stuff. I then pushed back up to give it another go. I love me some good technical fun!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ljFkNrVh.jpg" alt="The Slab from Above"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lQEK1Hnh.jpg" alt="The Slab from Below"></img>

    <p>As I was riding alone though and out there on my own, I didn't want to take any chances on an unexpected crash on the rock, so I continued on from there. On the map, there was a spot I thought I'd find some downhill single track. I headed that direction, but had to hunt to find the trail to get to the top, but eventually found it and headed up.</p>

    <p>The trails were a bit jumbled, and I wasn't sure if my gps was off. It wasn't off too far, but despite the map showing a few trails there, I only found two. Despite being just two, they were two good, raw, techy, fun trails; short but pretty awesome. Unfortunately an emphasis on the short aspect, as I felt like as soon as I started the trail it was popping back out at the road and kinda running out of decent options.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Wdu7e4wh.jpg" alt="Bummer"></img>

    <p>After a couple runs, I decided there unfortunately wasn't much there for me. I took the roll around and hit a few rocky lines and some fun features on the way back to the parking lot.</p>

    <p>With two somewhat lackluster trail networks already under my belt, I was a bit bummed about the mountain biking prospects. Those two spots came fairly well recommended, but didn't end up having much there, at least not much along the lines of what I like to ride.</p>

    <p>Doing what I should've done months beforehand, but now with a bit of a reference to what was there, I did the basic google search of 'best downhill mountain biking in Scotland', and found a couple other places that look more appetizing for riding. Most ended up fitting into the general trip route towards the end of my road trip. Pins on the map, time to keep on keepin' on.</p>

    <p>Back at Rupert, I lazily got changed and bummed around in the parking lot as I planned my next moves. Having a quality camp chair around is perfect for taking a load off for a break at the car. Using my handy-dandy space phone, I mapped out my next stops, got a plan in place for sleeping that night, and was off and rolling.</p>

    <p>First stop, Garlieston for some grub. Rolled into the tiny town, parked, and strolled along the harbor front for a bit before dipping into The Harbour Inn for dinner.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/indI5ggh.jpg" alt="The Scottish Flag"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ypaB7uQh.jpg" alt="Quiet Town Road"></img>

    <p>The Harbor Inn was a cozy little spot. Being the little tiny hole in the wall it is, it was packed to the gills. There was no space inside, so I was relegated to the patio. Not a bad relegation though.</p>

    <p>It was a calm spot outside, but I got some chicken and chili (which turned out to essentially just what I know as sweet and sour chicken) with some frieds (<em>chips</em>) and rice (thankfully just rice) to go with a cask golden ale. Both the drink and the food were pretty decent, and I was able to enjoy the meal on the mild summer evening.</p>

    <p>Back to Rupert, then off to my campsite. I'd been listening to Shantaram while driving, and it's a really enveloping book. Unfortunately, that means it's been taking my mind off the countryside a good bit. Beautiful countryside on the drive though, with so many goddamn sheep with a few cows sprinkled in.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0Lgnycyh.jpg" alt="Garlieston Main Drag"></img><br>

    <p>I'm not sure why, but for that night I opted for a more structured sleeping arrangement. In hindsight, it likely had a ton to do with wanting a shower and place to shave. I got in late, but got my tent popped up with a view out onto the ocean, did a little reading by the water, and then called it a night and tucked in for bed.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/DT62RUUh.jpg" alt="Rupert and Mr. Tent"></img><br>

    <h2 id="Day4-Galloway">Day 4 - Adventures in Galloway</h2>

    <p>In the tent it was a fairly easy wake-up, despite my shoulder/left back still killing me from the weeks prior. Once out of the tent and after a clean, warm shower, I got everything packed up, re-situated, and had some breakfast.</p>

    <p>Before I took off though, I went for a walk along the beach. The trail along the beach mirrored the road for a while, but eventually I jutted out onto a natural jetty to get a little closer to the water. It was quite a long jetty, so I didn't make it all the way out to the end. As I was walking out there, I kinda got over it, heavily influenced by the stench of exposed algae and barnacles. That was something I hadn't smelt in a long while. Whew...</p>

    <p class="quickhit">I don’t think this is the only reason why I like mountains more than sea/ocean, but ocean vistas are just so broad. It’s hard to capture it all in a picture. Mountains are the same, but there is height to it, elevation, something for the up and down, a little bit more depth and variation. In comparison, oceans and beaches and the like are primarily side to side, not a lot of height change. Just my 0.02...</p>

    <p>The trail back to the car was relaxing and quick, and once I got back I was off and rolling. As mentioned earlier, Shantaram was getting really engaging. I feel like audiobooks might be too much of a distraction or attention puller for me, as I really focus on the book and story, rather than taking in the countryside.</p>

    <p>Despite the audiobook distraction, I enjoyed the drive over to the Galloway Forest Park. There, it was a single-lane road through what felt like a jungle to get me into the park and where I wanted to go. But after maneuvering around some cars I got to the parking lot and started my little adventure.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ARvI6d7h.jpg" alt="Jungle Road"></img>

    <p>What was I there to check out? Well, a rock. But not just any rock! <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Glen_Trool">Bruce's Stone</a> was just a short hike up from the parking lot, and as things opened up, I headed over to the stone.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/KKt9ylth.jpg" alt="Looking Up to the Merrick"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QDTq4YOh.jpg" alt="Looking Out on the Lake"></img>

    <p>A beautiful overlook over the lake, Bruce's Stone is meant to commemorate the victory from the Battle of Glen Trool that Robert the Bruce helped orchestrate. A battle that helped start the campaign for Scottish independence. As it happened wayyyyy way back, there wasn't much (any) actual remnants of the battle, but envisioning an old 14th century battle in such a gorgeous valley and area was pretty cool.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hboBaFxh.jpg" alt="Bruce's Stone"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3QPIGGch.jpg" alt="Stone Backside"></img>

    <p>While enjoying the impressive stone and monument, as well as the beautiful view over the lake, I toyed with the idea of a hike up the Merrick (peak right on the lake) for the view, but just wasn’t feeling motivated enough for it. Another idea of taking a hike around the lake below the stone came into my, but I wasn't all too inspired about that either.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/kxLAH3Yh.jpg" alt="Far End of the Lake"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yPVCP4dh.jpg" alt="Road to the Parking Lot"></img>

    <p>In trying to figure out what I wanted to do next I got a little disappointed. As I was already at the car, I decided to just take a nap. Not as adventurous as I would've liked, but naps are always an acceptable choice, even if it's a backup.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">And here is a perfect example of the downside of both my method of travel, and part of my personality.</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Method of Travel</strong> - My preferred/predominant way to travel is to really not plan all that much out in advance. For example, leading up to this trip, I had a number of way-points, sights, things, and such that I wanted to do and pinned them on my map. From that, a general route organically came to be. Unfortunately for this trip, there was a good bit more research and ideation that should/could have taken place leading up to the journey - case in point, where to go mountain biking.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">Although I had a bunch of things planned out for further on during the trip, the stretch from where I was at to Glasgow was empty. This was daunting for my go-go-go mindset, as I wasn't sure what to dive into. My expectations were that I'd had some good mountain biking already in me, and would glow off that to some other things. But the lackluster biking kinda put me in a somber mood and made me realize I was lacking a plan and concrete things to do. That open-endedness and lack of clarity negatively affected me and got to my head.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">Now when I encounter a point where I feel like I ran out of ideas, then I (just like any other time) run into a point that I wasn't expecting, where more effort was required than anticipated to continue on. This leads me to...</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Personality</strong> - I have very weak mental fortitude. Nearly regardless of what I'm doing (weirdly enough, physical activity doesn't seem to be affected by this mentality), if I run into a point where the going gets tougher, I lose focus and momentum. I don't know how this has come to be of late, as I was not like this through college. But lately I've become very undisciplined and lacking perseverence to take a deep breath, readjust, realize I've gotta change tactics/effort/techinque/plans, and then go forward with a renewed vigor despite the increase in difficulty.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">This moment in time hit me like that. I had exhausted my ideas for that section of the trip and had to figure out what the rest of the plan was (increase of difficulty - not having something lined up next). This kinda daunted me, as such a blank slate of potential for things to do, analysis paralysis crept in and added to it. So with all of that impending, the easy way out was a nap to delay the decision.</p>

    <p>Once I woke up, it was time to be active. So first things first I just hit the road. This time, I just threw plans to the side and took the time to drive with no more maps. I knew I was eventually headed towards Glasgow, so that's what I followed on the signs. Time for some open, flexible, spontaneous adventuring.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">All the commentary above is valid and prevalent, for sure. Adding to that, this situation was likely just a bit of rust build-up from not traveling for so long. Finally back out on a new adventure, I had to get used to all the ups and downs of traveling again - slowly getting back into the swing of it...</p>

    <p>With a bit of a new lease on the day, I was off and ready to see what came my way. As I said, I jumped back on the road, and had the overall plan of slowly making my way to Glasgow. Shortly after starting out, I found my first place to stop, breathe, and enjoy the beautiful scenery.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/sRqOEqWh.jpg" alt="Calm Stream"></img>

    <p>After that first stop, it was only a short ways down the road once another pretty valley popped up and I decided to stop again to take in the beautiful countryside, and then again as the valley opened up to the ocean and the town of Girvan below. Nothing but gorgeous scenery.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/e9fLPJ5h.jpg" alt="Tree with a Blow-Over"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/4alZ9Lvh.jpg" alt="Islands Over Yonder"></img>

    <p>So far so good with the fun flexibility and adventuring. Not much further down the road was Girvan. Before I was fully in the thick of the town, I stopped and parked next to the wide open park with the intent of a little more extensive walk around town to get a vibe on the local flair.</p>

    <p>The park was a nice big expanse of grass with the local WWI and WWII memorial right in the middle. These types of memorials were really prevalent all over the country, and was very intriguing to see.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ftzI3Jih.jpg" alt="World War memorial"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Zlo7DuDh.jpg" alt="Homes on the Park"></img>

    <p>That giant hump of rock behind the monument in the picture there really stood out on the landscape. Naturally, I was intrigued, and luckily enough, further along down the way was a nice little sign to talk about it. Turns out, that little hunk of rock is named Ailsa Craig, and is resposible for all/most of the curling stones for the Olympics and Paralympics! What a cool little bit of trivia!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5F0S0JNh.jpg" alt="Ailsa Craig"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lhll4E3h.jpg" alt="Info Sign"></img>

    <p>From the memorial and sights of Ailsa Craig, I continued down the boardwalk and slowly made my way into town. Turned out to be a delightful little town to walk through, with a good bit going on. True to my typical routine in a city, it involved a lot of walking, a good bit of picture taking, and just quietly enjoying the town.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">For me, especially when I'm underway on my own, visiting a city is a fairly straightforward process and usually just involves walking around and taking pictures. Because I'm pretty stingy to begin with, I usually just stick to the walking because it's free, it keeps me mobile, and I get to experience/see a lot through that. Interactions with locals or people come up as they come up, but are not necessarily all-too-frequent, which means a lot of me-time to explore.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/q01ygF4h.jpg" alt="Leave Nothing but your Footprints"></img>

    <p>Girvan turned out to be a beautiful little harbor town, with enough activity to keep your head on a swivel, but small enough to make it a relaxing swivel around. I walked by some workers pulling some fish farm nets and loading them onto a truck for cleaning, watched some underwater welders get suited up and ready for a dive, stopped and got myself some soft-serve (not the biggest fan, but it was sugary and I was hungry), and had an overall delightful and relaxed time on a nice little mosey on through a gorgeous little town on the coast.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">As is evident from the pictures, it was my third day in Scotland already, but I had yet to see my full shadow. A partial appearance occurred briefly a couple times, but holding to its stereotype, Scotland held true to be the land of grey skies (but thankfully no rain yet!).</p>

    <p>Once my little loop through town and the various sights of Girvan was through, my plan was to keep motoring on. Dinner time was approaching, so after a little looking on the map, I spooted Ayr as the target to get some grub. But, thanks to a handy little feature of Google Maps, I'd spotted something to go check out on the way, so I pointed Rupert in that direction and I was off!</p>

    <p>The drive took me through some more gorgeous countryside. With the pin in the map, the route essentially dropped me off across the street from some kind of machine shop. The road to the castle looked not too receptive, so I was a little unsure of what I was in for. But I parked and started my search for <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalquharran_Castle">Dalquharran Castle</a>.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Z1qUfNUh.jpg" alt="Beautiful Farmland"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/sRlPpRSh.jpg" alt="Farm Road - No Entry"></img>

    <p>Turns out my intuition was firing on all cylinders, as there was a fence with a clear prohibition of vehicles clarified. Good job Me. But past that, it was a bit of a weird walk in. A bit wooded to start along a pretty well trodden logging road, and then I took a trail that I thought pointed in the direction of the stonework I saw through the bushes, but soon felt misled for a hot sec as it led to a field and then a giant wall of hedges. Dun dun dun...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZychOnih.jpg" alt="Castle through the Trees"></img>

    <p>Despite the initial scepticism and worry, that wall of hedges had an opening. Not wanting to go further in the wrong direction, I dove into the hole in the hedges to see where things go. After the break in the stone wall, I was led down a tunnel of trees, and then voila, a castle!!!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/JFcjsNlh.jpg" alt="Hole in the Hedges"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XfJzmuTh.jpg" alt="Dalquharran Castle"></img>

    <p>I'd stumbled upon not just any kinda castle, but luckily enough an abandoned/derelict castle. How dope! As I rolled up, I had no idea about the history or background of the place, but would've guessed it was built sometime in the 1800s. Maybe. I'm not good at guessing. (<em>Wasn't far off though - per Wikipedia built in 1790</em>) More importantly though, how does a giant, well-built place like this become abandoned!?</p>

    <p>I'm not sure how this was listed as an attraction on google maps, but despite the "Stay Out", "Danger", and "Warning" signs, there was a little hole in the castle wall that was conviently not fenced in. You know me, time to dive in.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3hHbA7lh.jpg" alt="Getting into the Courtyard"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/916RmPUh.jpg" alt="The Full Castle"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/1Nz9LuJh.jpg" alt="Side Patio"></img>

    <p>Once I entered the castle, I was surprised and a bit bummed to see the majority of the inside of the place to be fully gutted. Not just the plaster, the decorations, or just the coverings and such, but the floors and cross beams and bigger stuff. Despite that, there were tons of cavernous rooms and spots with nature taking completely over. Pretty cool place to explore around.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/MlHRChFh.jpg" alt="Trail through the Dining Room"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/uEuFE3Gh.jpg" alt="Circular Missing Staircase"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/11ncig9h.jpg" alt="Floor-be-Gone"></img>

    <p>After meandering around the ground level, I wandered my way down to the basement, and it got a little weird and creepy. Back up to the main level, I wandered around a bit more and then stumbled upon the only intact staircase in the place. Seeking an adventure, I went up it and delightedly found that it took me all the way up to the roof of one of the two entry towers. How dope!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/iCqZod3h.jpg" alt="Basement Hallway"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/AcW4Gpyh.jpg" alt="Basement Room"></img>

    <p>Being up on the roof was prety damn cool, but also a little bit weird. I wouldn't say I'm scared of heights, per-se, but being up there, alone, in an abandoned castle, I was a good bit on edge. Although stone is a reliably strong material, I had no idea how old it was. Being four stories up with no harness or saftey other than my sensibilities, I wasn't going to take any chances.</p>

    <p>Using those good sensibilities, I selectively wandered about the few existing and trustworthy ramparts. Not too far away from the staircase, but it was pretty interesting to explore some more viewpoints. While I was up there, another couple came into the ruins and was wandering around with their dogs. Just so I didn't freak them out, I said hello from up high and all were enjoying the exploration.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/OB3hs0vh.jpg" alt="Another Overgrown Corner"></img>

    <p>Definitely cool to be up there and enjoy the giant abandoned, gutted structure from above. But returning to safer ground I headeed back down the tower staircase and found myself wandering over to the other building. Looked like the smaller side building used to be a stable or something, but it was quite a dump. It smelt like urine, was muggy, and there was garbage all over the place. Despite the constant mentality in places like that (just like in video games) trying to find little discoveries, there was nothing to be had there...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yog9epSh.jpg" alt="From Inside the Stable"></img>

    <p>What a cool spot to spelunk around. Although it's not exactly a secure location, sure glad google had that listed as an attraction. I was kinda over the urine smell, so left Building #2 and decided to slowly work my way outta there. Quite the cool-as-hell find. Sweet stuff. The way out had me round-about back to the road, and I was happy to find Rupert sitting there waiting for me!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/x2xuK1jh.jpg" alt="A Field Down Yonder"></img>

    <p>Jumping back in, I headed off to Ayr for some dinner. I had a good place in mind, and once I got into town and parked (didn't have to pay!!!), I headed over to the restaurant. Well, once again I ended up heading to a place that was said to be open (their website and google), but after calling I learned that they were closed. What gives with that?!? Huge bummer too, because their seafood looked absolutely delicious.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/JXF620vh.jpg" alt="Clocktower Downtown"></img>

    <p>I was a good bit bummed, and therefore hemmed and hawwed on trying to find a fallback. After a bit of searching and indecision, I decided on a spot that was thankfully pretty close by. Again a bit of a weird feeling dining alone, but it was a nice spot. The waitresses were super friendly and helped me audible to get a little salmon on my mac and cheese for some extra deliciousness. Overall, friendly spot, good food, and a nice little place to fuel up.</p>

    <p>After dinner, I didn't have a plan or anything laid out, but on the walk back to the car I continued with the fun flexibility and followed what piqued my eyes. What piqued my eyes? Smoking Goat. Helluva name, and turned out to be a great little hole in the wall.</p>

    <p>Got in, talked to the somewhat nice bartender, snagged a lager, and then headed out to the back patio. Turned out to be a bit more clubby than I thought, but the patio outside was a nice place to wind down. While I slowly sipped, I got caught up on some things and researched potential places to park and clock out for the night.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XZnc0dAh.jpg" alt="Smoking Goat"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">Here I learned a lesson I tried to implement throughout the rest of the trip - go with the flow! Show up, walk around, see what looks good, and go with your eyes and gut. Solely relying on your phone to make decisions is not the right way to go.</p>

    <p>While walking back to the care, I ended up walking through the Loudoun Hall, one of the oldest buildings in town. Not sure how much of it was original, but it was built in the 15th Century. Crazy to walk through places in Europe that are hundreds of years older than the country I grew up in. Tons of history, tons of memories for eras past.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/b7zy01Gh.jpg" alt="Loudoun Hall Replica"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/6M2B7bwh.jpg" alt="Loudoun Hall and Town"></img>

    <p>Back at Rupert, I hopped in and headed out to find a spot to sleep. On the hunt, I realized just how perfect the spot from the first night was - tucked away from the road and quiet, harder to find all over the place. But I got to the first spot I'd scoped out. it was on a decent hill, and was at a seemingly well-traveled intersection. Wasn't feeling it.</p>

    <p>Off to the second spot I scoped out, and that was even more well traveled. Damn. But, in the interest of not wasting all night trying to find a place, I found spot two was at least a good enough distance from the road for a bit of solitude. So I parked, got situated, and kinda just crashed. Unfortunately though, it was a bit of a tossy-turny night due to my achy back and the lights from the cars nearby. Oh well, that's how it goes.</p>

    <h2 id="Day5-Glasgow">Day 5 - Sunlight guides me to Glasgow</h2>

    <p>Despite the tough night's sleep, I woke up in great spirits. Why, you ask? I was greeted with the first bit of sunshine for the trip! The first day of September bringing my first sunshine in Scotland. Hot damn!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/NCwD7GUh.jpg" alt="Sunrise at the Sleep Spot"></img>

    <p>Despite the sunshine, I was a bit lazy in getting up and getting put back together. It was an early start though with the bright light, so no worries. First things first, off to find some breakfast. Once again, despite finding it on the map, I rolled up and the cafe in question didn't look to exist. What the heck... Another audible leads to another great decision - time for some Timbits! No idea Canada had an embassy in Scotland!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/9EmP1jph.jpg" alt="Timbits!"></img>

    <p>My next stop was to go explore the nearby town of Troon. on the way though, I cruised by an airport and saw what I thought was the <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya">Antonov AN-225</a>, the biggest airplane in the world. Not wanting to miss the opportunity to see another engineering marvel, I made my way along the airport and got out to explore and see what I could find. Turns out it wasn't that one, but a different Russian-flagged craft, so I took some pictures, tried not to look too suspicious in front of the Royal Military base, and even spotted a US C-17. Seemed a bit out of place.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/W7OQkbmh.jpg" alt="Following my Shadow"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Gr6B55uh.jpg" alt="Russian Ship"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ncovOJth.jpg" alt="US C-17"></img>

    <p>Thankfully no Military Police came out to nab me, so I packed it in, enjoyed some more timbits, and then made my way over to Troon. Still looking for a bit of sustenance to start the day, I got into town, parked, and wandered over to the cafe nearby, Drift. Got in, snagged an açaí bowl (felt a little required to eat something healthy...), a coffee, grabbed my book, and headed out to the sidewalk to enjoy it all in a calm manner.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">Not gonna lie, but I was very much out of my element in a way. Listening to an audiobook, AND reading a paperback?! This is the most literary activity I've had in a while!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/E1Y2ZVsh.jpg" alt="Flags Across"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q85GaVnh.jpg" alt="Breakfast in the Sunshine"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">I gotta say, I'm not a fan of the short, squat coffee cups. Too easy to slosh around and spill something. Gimme a tall coffee mug, and all is right in the world. They feel better in your hands and they're a better vessel.</p>

    <p>Breakfast was a really relaxing delight, and with the sunshine warming things up, I had to head back to the car to get some shorts before starting my round of exploration. There was a public toilet where I parked, and with the increase in people out and about, I knew I had to head there before getting called out for indecency (or maybe that would only happen in the prudish US...).</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, after gathering my stuff (wanted to brush my teeth too), I learned that it cost 30 pence just to get in. Damnit. I tried jumping the gate, but the damn thing just started beeping at me.</p>

    <p>I headed back to my car, wrangled up what change I had, and gave it another try. Well, I only had bigger change on the order of 1 pound. I threw it in, but that just made it jam up, as it only accepted exact change. I tried to fish the big coin out of there, but the damn thing wouldn't budge. You gotta be kidding me...</p>

    <p>While I was there looking like an idiot, an older dude walked in and looked at me like the idiot I was. He asked what I was doing, I was a bit worried I was in some trouble, but I answered him and then he told me to give him my shorts. Come again? A bit of a weird request, so I naturally hesitated. But at his third request, I handed them over and he grabbed them and just waved them behind the gate and boom! The gates just opened right up. What a wiley old bastard :-) I got in, got changed, brushed my teef, and now I was off on an exploratory walk!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7cmezpGh.jpg" alt="Another WW Memorial"></img>

    <p>The sunlight really made everything pop. Just lovely to be able to wander around on such a beautiful day! With the low tide, the mid-morning freshness, there was tons to see and not a lot of commotion.</p>

    <p>I started out heading to the waterfront from the parking lot, and following the promenade down the way. After passing some colorful buildings, I rolled up to a large grassy knoll and headed up it to get a good view over the water and then continued on to a fantastically placed bench for a little break.</p>

    <p>While taking a load off at the bench, I enjoyed the beautiful sights on the water while diving into my book. But then, after a few rounds of stopping to take in the beautiful view, I noticed a Coast Guard helicopter just hovering over yonder. No idea what it was doing, but I was intrigued, so I finished up my chapter, packed my bag back up and continued on.</p>

    <p>That pesky helicopter kept on hovering as I made my way along whatever beach access I could find to get me a little closer. That ended up taking me down onto the beach and I got to check out some cool tide pools. After exploring those there for a bit, I was kinda done and headed back to the road. Of course, right at that time the copter decided to roll on out with me.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iacqItWh.jpg" alt="Copter on the Move"></img>

    <p>Back on the road, that was unforutnately the end of the park/beach area. But no worries, I wandered over through the part of the pier that was open, said hi to some seagulls, and got to watch a bunch of lazy seals bobbing in the water waiting to mooch some fresh caught fish from any of the fishing boats. No dice for them though.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/W9tr2eyh.jpg" alt="Portland House"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">Turns out, Portland Street is the main drag through town! Gotta love a little bit of Oregon everywhere!</p>

    <p>From the end of the harbor area, I turned and headed towards town. Once a bit more park opened up, I jumped over there and found another appealing bench for a nice quick break. The break was (and usually always is) nice, and from there I circled back to town on the hunt for some lunch.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0OzkAlih.jpg" alt="Masts Galore"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/P5HpOn2h.jpg" alt="A Quiet Road"></img>

    <p>Using the no-google approach, I jumped into the first bar that looked appealing. Unfortunately, they only had booze, no food, but the lady asked the folks at the other side of the bar for seafood recommendations. They shared one, but I passed that up and ended going back to The Harbor Bar, which I spotted on my walk earlier in the day. Boom! Gotta love a name that's so straightforward, simple, and perfectly accurate.</p>

    <p>Walked in and found myself a spot back in the beer garden. And then I waited. Thankfully I'd grabbed my beer at the bar before heading back while asking some questions. Turned out the waitress was brand new and still getting her sea legs under her. She was a super friendly gal and was doing just fine, so I sipped my beer in patience and enjoyed the moment.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/agpT1qsh.jpg" alt="Beavertown Brew"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">Not sure how, but that glass somehow found its way to my kitchen cupboard. Interesting coincidence...</p>

    <p>While waiting, I did a good bit of reading on Jo Nesbo's <em>Kingdom</em>. After long last though, my Keep it Shrimple hobo joined the table and I was super excited. Essentially their version of a hobo is just a bunch of shit dumped on <em>chips</em>. Definitions aside, that shit was delicious. So was the beer.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/X7CQKaZh.jpg" alt="Keep It Shrimple Start"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FzW9cBxh.jpg" alt="Keep It Shrimple End"></img>

    <p>The Harbor Bar - Great spot for a delicious pause. But soon enough I'd finished up my meal and was back out on the street. From there, I kinda backtracked along my route from earlier back to the car. Well, I wanted to stop off for a bio break before hitting the road again. But as I walked past that same restroom from earlier, there was an "Out of Order" sign on the door. Hmmmmm.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/upl3tveh.jpg" alt="A Trio of Friends"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5XIENFKh.jpg" alt="A Little More Activity"></img>

    <p>Back in the car and back on the move. For some reason, Google really likes finding the most direct route, which coincidentally is definitely not always the most well traveled route. There were way too many times I was directed through blind corners and feeling like I’m driving down someone’s driveway. Maybe that’s the uk, but Google's getting a little cheeky in my opinion.</p>

    <p>The next stop on the adventure was still inching me closer to Glasgow, but not without a stop in <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderslie">Elderslie</a> first for a little trip down Scottish History lane.</p>

    <p>Despite never having seen Braveheart, I had to stop in to a monument dedicated to the hero of Scottish Independence, William Wallace. The site was presumed to be where he lived for a majority of his youth before becoming the helm of the movement for Scottish Independence. After Wallace passed, that helm was passed on to Robert the Bruce, but Wallace was the strong leader that got things rolling.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/30DzxhJh.jpg" alt="Wallace Monument Sign"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/K5kpLQUh.jpg" alt="Homes Across the Street"></img>

    <p>I rolled up and walked into the little park with the multiple monuments  and informative signs. First things first, I did a little reading on the first sign and it said that the gas station next door had a pamphlet to read further but they didn’t. I headed down there and the lady said the signs at the monument were a little old. Bummer.</p>

    <p>Back to the monument to take it all in. Small but quaint and informative setup. Great stonework, a beautiful day, and a good place to learn some more about the impactful hero of Scottish Independence.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3B69nW0h.jpg" alt="Wallace and a Sign"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UMcApi8h.jpg" alt="Full Colors On"></img>

    <p>From there it was on to Glasgow! From Elderslie it was just a short drive to the largest city in Scotland. Weirdly enough though, despite it being the largest city, there were no skyscrapers of note on the skyline during the drive in. Honestly a fairly flat skyline, but I was stoked to be pulling into town!</p>

    <p>Rather than trying to find a place to sleep in my car in town, I opted for my stint in Glasgow for finding a cheap hotel. Once I got into town I headed that way and got checked in. Thankfully I was able to find a parking spot directly out front of the hotel. That put me a little more at easy with my precious bike just sitting on the roof of the car. Double U-Locks and I felt like I was in pretty good shape.</p>

    <p>After I got checked in, I laid around a little bit to relax for a hot second. But, not wanting to waste the good day, I got up and started exploring around Glasgow's West End.</p>

    <p>Not a stone's throw away from the hotel was a big 'ole park. Next stop - that place. The first piece of note was a giant, extremely well manicured lawn bowling center. Unforuntately, no activity or action on there, so I strolled on by and continued on.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UxcUDdLh.jpg" alt="Lawn Bowling Center"></img>

    <p>From there the park slowly melted into the University of Glasgow campus, the fourth oldest university in the UK! To add to it, they've got a pretty cool tag line - "Changing the World since 1451". Not bad.</p>

    <p>Up the hill, I wandered past some statues of Lord Lister (pioneer of antiseptic surgery) and Lord Kelvin (you know, Degrees Kelvin...), past the Engineering Building (looked pretty old), and then made my way into the courtyard(s) of the prominent main building. It was extremely impressive, and old. For some reason, as I was wandering through it, I had a vague memory that that building was a partial inspiration for Hogwarts. Not sure if true or not, but definitely impressive.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/lFelqlPh.jpg" alt="Tower through the Trees"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/EdNzGTmh.jpg" alt="Massive Columns"></img>

    <p>In the first courtyard, then through the covered foyer to the other amongst a gaggle of folks taking grad pictures and some folks hanging out on the lawn. Beautiful building on a beautiful day, hard to pass that up. Wandered around Courtyard #2, then back out to the street out front of the building for a bit of a view over the town.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BjHfqN8h.jpg" alt="Art and Architecture"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/6BKgmUUh.jpg" alt="Front of the Building"></img>

    <p>After wandering around the main building, I headed up an alleyway and was encountered by a staircase with statues of both a gilded lion and a gilded unicorn. The lion, I can get. The unicorn? Had no idea what was up with that.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/udx01qAh.jpg" alt="Lion and Unicorn"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/NPbxt5hh.jpg" alt="Unicorn and Lion"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">At some point later on in the trip, I was interacting with a local Scot and inquired about this quizzical unicorn. Well, the lion made sense, as it's the official animal/mascot (feel like there's a different descriptor for this) of the UK. And as I was told, the unicorn is the same but for Scotland. Being such a unique and magical place, why the hell not have a unicorn be your official animal!?! Love it.</p>

    <p>I continued my meandering through campus, and set my sights on the library, as that looked to be the biggest building around. I headed into the lobby, but got pretty quickly turned around. No heading up to the tallest point in the building for a lookout over the city if you're not a student. Whomp whomp whomp...</p>

    <p>Continuing on, campus slowly morphed into a bit of a trendy restaurant/bar district along a touristy cobblestone street with some cool street art (will be diving into more of that later), and then down a big commercial avenue, before weaving my way through a bunch of stuff to get down towards the River Clyde.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/h4dRw7wh.jpg" alt="Glasgow Diagon Alley"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/psSMGToh.jpg" alt="Sweet Spiderweb"></img>

    <p>My meandering was leading me towards the tall ship and the museum nearby. But as I approached, I realized I wasn't going to be able to get to it, because they were setting up for some kind of festival. How cool!</p>

    <p>Well, trying to be friendly while some dudes were installing some rigging or stage or something and a few building a temporary fence to block off the path I was headed towards, I asked what was going on. As soon as I asked, the oldest and fattest guy of the group, without skipping a beat, said, "Oh, aren’t you a little to old for that now...”, and not in the form of a question. Well fuck. No hiding it now... Not gonna lie, I was a good bit dejected after that, but I continued my walk and weaved my way through the quasi construction site to try to get to the waterfront path.</p>

    <p>The closer to the water, the more things to see. And this holds true (so far in my experience) the world over. But there is nothing like a city with an appreciable body of water in or through it. Seriously. It contributes to such a great atmosphere, a little more relaxed vibe, and provides a great place to relax.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">Glasgow really reminded me a lot of Portland, Seattle, and Hamburg. I got lucky to hit it on some good weather (and not the pissing rain it's known for), but such a beautiful city!</p>

    <p>As I worked my way to the waterfront, I was thoroughly enjoying the great sunlight, the awesome street art, and the incredible pencil of a building across the river.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/YjdlJQ0h.jpg" alt="The Airfoil from afar"></img><br>

    <p>Once at the waterfront, I hung around to try and snag a good picture, but ended up not getting it. Badummmm. Continuing on over the bridge I had my sights set on that cool looking tower. The sun was slowly creeping down the sky, so the golden light was really adding a delicious glow onto everything in sight.</p>

    <p>Getting across and walking over to the giant toothpick (actually the <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Tower">Glasgow Science Center Tower</a>), it was unfortunately closed. Not just closed because it was late in the day, but still closed down due to Covid. HUGEEEE Bummer. Huge. But, while hanging out on the pedastal at the bottom of the tower, I watched a snippet of the ‘About Me’ video for the tower, and the whole thing rests on a 65cm ball bearing so the whole tower can rotate. Now that's some cool shit.</p>

    <img class="pano" src="https://i.imgur.com/tZxOOEUh.jpg" alt="Pano on the River Clyde"></img>

    <p>What a beautiful day. And to add to all that beauty and awesomeness, I had California Honeydrops' <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SqmpkG8new"><em>Tell Me (I Wanna Know)</em></a> stuck in my head for the entirety of my delightful little walk. A sunny day, a bubbly song, it was all putting me in a real good mood just sitting there and enjoying it all. What a great song.</p>

    <p>Energized, yet relaxed, and full of enjoyment on the gorgeous day, I got up and continued my sauntering through town. By that time, the sun decided to finalize its goodbye for the day, and put some beautiful reds and oranges on the town as it did so. I walked past and over a few gorgeous bridges, and checked out this giant (no longer operational) crane on the opposite bank before pointing back towards the west side of town.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ttNcPm7h.jpg" alt="The C Bridge with Boardwalk"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/S7FhAxXh.jpg" alt="Crane Up there"></img>

    <p>At that point, after a pretty good loop around town, I was hungry and needed some food. Stat. Once again, I went with my gut and stumbled upon the first place I looked at, but they had already closed their kitchen. Damnit. So I backtracked to a Persian joint. Turned out to be MONEY. Got me some lamb kabobs, and that shit was delicious.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cs695Zjh.jpg" alt="Lamb Kabobiness"></img>

    <p>I luckily enough got the one table that was out on the street. It was tight, and the sidewalk was small, so there was some good activity all around. While sitting and eating, there was a group of three gals that were hanging around waiting for their takeout. At first it annoyed the hell out of me having people kinda hovering over me while I sat and ate, but after a while it was amusing to listen to their chatter, or at least what I could make out of it through the thick accent.</p>

    <p>Solid calories achieved, it was time for some liquid ones. With that, I wrapped up dinner, then walked back to the first place I dipped into (craft beer bar!!!! :-D). Walked in, friendly chat with the bartender, and settled on a good IPA from Ireland, which the bartender had a nice hinte of amber to its taste. He was right. and it was yummy.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/m7EaGayh.jpg" alt="Beer on the Bench"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7lwmL8Sh.jpg" alt="The Dirty Duchess"></img>

    <p>A great beer in hand, a good book to read, and a nice night to sit out and watch the world go by. Unfortunately, rules in Glasgow made the street shut down fairly early, but I was able to still relaxedly finish my drink before I got booted indoors. From there, it was back to the hotel to realize I didn't have a functional power adapter with me, down to the corner store to get one, then back and off to bed.</p>

    <h2 id="Day6-Glasgow">Day 6 - The Colors of Glasgow</h2>

    <p>For some reason I slept like shit and just rolled around for the two hours leading up to my alarm going off. That was annoying. But I eventually got up and cleaned up before heading down for breakfast. Plans changed quickly as I learned that it wasn't included with the room. Oh well, off to a cafe to start the day!</p>

    <p>My plan for the day was a self-guided tour of the city followed by a guided tour of an aspect of the city, so the morning was meant for the city center. Ready to go I hit the street and headed towards downtown, but stopped off at the Ottoman Coffeehouse on the way, and it was a perfect spot for the biggest chocolate croissant I've ever seen, some fancy-ass hipster coffee, and time to relax in a comfy chair with my book.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vAicnBJh.jpg" alt="Standard Glasgow Street"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CEgrizeh.jpg" alt="Coffeeshop Aura"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uzSdNm1h.jpg" alt="Coffee and Reading"></img>

    <p>After the comfy and cozy cafe, I was back out onto the somewhat cold, fresh, and grey streets; a clear contrast to the day before. I meandered the streets, enjoying the vibe of just another day in town. Doing a bit of a zig and a zag, there were a ton of fancy-schmancy cars on display as I made my way to the National Piping Center!!!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/jqG5bCDh.jpg" alt="A Street Coming Downhill"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UwFq6bmh.jpg" alt="The Piping Museum"></img>

    <p>As we all know, Piping (bagpiping to the non-Scots of the world) is sterotypically pegged to Scotland, but as I came to learn, it's an honest representation, and a treasured part of their history and culture. The museum was small but informative, interesting, and showcased some cool exhibits. Throughout it did a great job of showcasing the role the bagpipe has played in Scotland's history, starting as an instrument and gradually morphing into a sign of pride, strength, clandom, a battle procession, and so much more. To add to it, I finally learned how the damn thing works!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/4bK8W32h.jpg" alt="Piping Center Start Sign"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/N7hj8Eeh.jpg" alt="A couple piping signs"></img>

    <p>After an insightful cultural excursion, I thanked the museum staff, and was back out into the city and in the thick of it. The Piping Center was really close to tourist row, and I headed through it. I'm really not a fan of shopping districts, but it was the most direct route. I made my way through it and headed to one of the main squares.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VWW7STLh.jpg" alt="Shopping Street"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SDA0Mpjh.jpg" alt="Glasgow War Memorial"></img>

    <p>Continuing on, I weaved my way through the east side of downtown. Lots of semi-busy streets, but plenty of quiet corners along the way. Beautiful buildings, a random Clocktower literally in the middle of the street, and just some pretty views to keep the wandering feet and eyes occupied.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lFdUagkh.jpg" alt="Nested Portals"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QZB2QCZh.jpg" alt="A Little Ivy Cleaning"></img>

    <p>My stroll eventually had me on the eastern edge of downtown as I made my way to the bigger park over on that side, which was home to the People's Palace. Well, as luck would have it, they were setting up for another festival in that park, so there was no way to go check out the palace. In fact, options were pretty limited even for walking through, so I just essentially did a loop around the fence to point me back towards town.</p>

    <p>At that point in the mid-morning, I had to start watching the clock so I wouldn't miss my tour. But once I got to the waterfront, I headed back towards town with my sights set on some food. After walking by some pretty bridges, google showed me there was an Afghan restaurant briefly across the bridge. Boom. Done.</p>

    <p>After the short walk from the bridge I arrived and got myself a table. Once I ordered, I took off my glasses to rub my eyes. It was a damn good thing I did, because one of the arms was barely being held on by a thread!!! The screw holding on the left arm had somehow back itself out and was nearly gone. What the hell?! The flange was bent and screw ready to pop out, but I had no idea how that had happened...</p>

    <p>While I was freaking out about that, I got in my lunch order and got some naan bread to go with it. With unfortunately nothing small enough on me to help with the screw, I looked up a glasses shop I could head to right after lunch before the tour. But before I could drown myself in worry, the food tidal wave hit me.</p>

    <p>Started off with the salad, which was fresh and delicious, and was best with whatever red sauce that came with it. Next, the naan and hummus, also delicious, and also best with a little of that red sauce dribbled on top. Then, the lamb chapiti, with an additional two discs of naan. Holy shit it was a lot of food, and holy shit was it all extremely delicious. I couldn't finish it all, but that meant I had some walking snacks to take with me!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/X3kFo1Bh.jpg" alt="Nomnomnomnomnom"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">The day I was there was just a few days after allied forces completed their withdrawal from Kabul, and after the terrible travesty that was the poorly managed and implemented withdrawal. News of the humanitarian crisis and the devastating scenes as the taliban took over and people were desparately doing anything to get out of there were hard to watch, and embarassing to know that after 20 years of war and oil hunting, my country did not do much to help the people that helped them escape from a terrible situation. That's a subjective review of the situation, but all-in-all, it was extremely sad to see what was going on.</p>

    <p>Time was running short before the tour started, so I bolted from the restaurant back across the river to the nearest glasses shop I could find to see if someone could fix them. Long story short, kinda. The guy was super nice and ready to help, but they didn’t have the right tools to help (which didn't make sense, it was just a small philipps head...). At some point I took the tools and got it to a point where it was screwed in enough to hold for a while. I just couldn’t fold the glasses together or else the screw would pop out again. Damn.</p>

    <p>At least, for the time being, they were serviceable enough to get me through the day. I just had to whip out my tools once I got back to my car. But from there, I was off to the Street Art tour! Super glad I came up with that idea and plan.</p>

    <p>As I arrived at the meeting spot, felt I was in the wrong place, but I ended up walking past the tour group to start. But, everyone present, and we were off! To be honest, I felt bad for the tour guide, as she was a semi-shy college student who had to shout pretty hard at every stop with the commotion of the city all around her. All in all, great way to walk around the city and learn about the country, the city, and the awsome culture/rules and atmosphere of the street art scene in Glasgow, such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you’re well known and respected, it's less likely that others will tag or paint over you</li>
      <li>A black line through your work is the biggest insult you can get</li>
      <li>Most of it's illegal, but the commissioned stuff can get you a pretty penny</li>
      <li>There are many different ways to go about it - stencil, freehand, projection, and maybe more</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Well, our tour took us all throughout downtown to a number of pretty incredible works of art. Rather than going in detail, here's a bunch of pictures with some descriptions:</p>

    <p>The piece de resistance was the first one we saw. It's reportedly an image of the artist's ex-girlfriend, titled <em>Not Dead Yet</em>. No lie, I was cracking up every time we saw this, as I can only imagine how pissed that woman must be to see her pissed off face plastered all over town!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/tpObs17h.jpg" alt="Not Dead Yet 1"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Hl5IUizh.jpg" alt="Not Dead Yet 2"></img>

    <p>Right at where the tour started was one of an awesome panda (which apparently has been painted over since I was there), and one of a self-portrait of one of the local artists.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eEatozTh.jpg" alt="Panda and Kanye"></img>

    <p>Aptly titled <em>Wind Power</em>, a work by Rogue-One (who had his hands on a ton of walls in town), that is an absolutely beautiful concept. My favorite color with one of my favorite pieces of machinery.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vdzLmiih.jpg" alt="Wind Power 1"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iDtVm73h.jpg" alt="Wind Power 2"></img>

    <p>A work by Smug of his girlfriend picking up us puny humans. Incredible size and detail.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/wsnLiZsh.jpg" alt="Smug Shrunk"></img>

    <p>Rogue-One painted this, I think for one of the many climate conferences years back. <em>The World's Most Economic Taxi</em>, cool enough, the bricks on the wall are painted on rather than real.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/HoqxURAh.jpg" alt="Central Station"></img>

    <p>This friendly thief :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MCmj0FVh.jpg" alt="Friendly Thief"></img>

    <p>No way of confirming this, but as per our tour guide, this is one of the first ever Banksy works (and apparently silver lettering says Banksy, I'm not so sure...). Huge diss that he was black-striped. But again, not sure if it's actually Banksy.</p>

    <h2 id=""></h2>

    	• Incredible the level of detail possible on auch massive works of art
    	• Liked negative destination with his little cactus guys, and the ones that I’d seen the day before
    	• Incredibly impressive works of art. Really cool to see and experience
    	• Got to chatting with a couple at the end of the tour, fellow residents of glasgow
    	• Derrick and Susan after the street art tour. Chatted over the art at first, and since this was the first deeper interaction I’d had with some scots I asked them about the independence referendum, surprised, he was against it. Works in finance and his company (and others) said if it’s a yes they’re moving out. Kinda felt similar to brexit in that sense
    	• We chatted about politics and the state of the world and such, then headed out for a beer
    	• Great conversation and laughs and all that, really nice folks
    	• Had to piss like a race horse and they wouldn’t let me pay for the bill
    	• Exchanged contact info and plan is to meet up once I’m on my way back down through Edinburgh
    	• From there headed back to the hotel and saw my other plans fell through, open evening
    	• Back to the hotel for stable wifi and my fantasy football draft. Aaron Rodgers baby. Let’s go.
    	• Finished drafting but finished up my leftovers from lunch in the process. Damn good stuff
    	• Down to the nearest place that looked like they had whiskey. Got the recommendation of the Bunnahabhain and a recommendation on a beer to go with it
    	• Got to pet a cute lab a have a brief chat with the dudes sitting next to me outside, otherwise getting caught up on blog notes and people watching
    	• From there off to bed

    2021.09.03
    	• Time to leave Glasgow, bummer. Definitely a cool town with more to explore
    	• First things first was breakfast at The Brunch Club. Some pretty good eggs Benny with too little hollandaise and some damn good bacon
    	• Said hi to a puppy on the way out and learned that pit bulls are illegal in Scotland (wtf!!?). They gal brought him with from Texas and says he’s some kind of Stafford terrier mix or something to get away with it
    	• With that in the car, had to stop aT St Munro first, beautiful piece of street art
    	• On the road again
    	• Either Google loves to take me through the most backroad routes, or there are just so few main roads the back roads are the only way. Could be both
    	• After a quick drive I rolled up to Glengoyne for my first distillery visit! Not sure why this was on my maps, as I’d never been, but I marked it at some point so there had to be a good reason
    	• Early, so walked up to the waterfall, chatted with Owen the tour guide for a bit, then soon enough we were off
    	• Technically not allowed to take pictures, but you know me :-) A couple cool things about Glengoyne:
    		○ a Highland Single Malt whisky
    		○ 100% renewable energy powered
    		○ known as a slow distiller, where the second distillation is done at a slower pace than other distilleries 2x5L/min instead of 1x10L/min
    		○ they still use wooden washbacks and are one of a small group of distilleries to do so (fun facts!!! The wood used for these things is Oregon Pine because the branches are all at the top of the tall trees with no knots in the middle. No knots = no seepage! Second, those things cost about $60,000. Dayum
    		○ the only step in the process they don’t do onsite is the step with the mash
    		○ The Daff/Draff is no longer used for animal feed, but now as fuel for biogas energy gen
    	• Cool tour, but I did the responsible thing since I’m driving and got my tastings to-go. Wanted to try them out but held off
    	• Jumped to the store, got a small bottle and back to the car
    	• Ready to go hike Ben Lomond after some lunch, but google maps popped up with an attraction nearby. Hadn’t heard of it, looked interesting though, so I was off to check it out
    	• Super glad I did!!! Devil’s pulpit, essentially this anomaly of a canyon right in the middle of a bunch of farm fields
    	• Not a long canyon, the inlet and outlet, where it goes from field to canyon and vice versa, are both within a 10ish minute walk from side to side
    	• Incredible natural thing though, super deep, at least 40-50ft down to the floor
    	• Walked around, checked it out from above then saw that there were two spots where you could go down into it! How dope! Definitely did
    	• Way cool stop, such an unexpected treat!
    	• From there, off to go hike Ben Lomond and atppped for food along the way
    	• The Clachan Inn, licensed in 1734
    	• Got lucky with parking, as where I’d parked was technically illegal although there was a line of cars parked there. I’m that moment though the parking inspectors were coming through so I asked and got the clarity I needed
    	• Before I pulled away though the one guy asked where my car was registered, I said Germany, and he replied that they wouldn’t be able to get the money from me ilanyeays. Good to know but I moved Rupert anyways
    	• Got to the Inn and sat at the bar. Got a nice amber from Belhaven, eventually got my burger ordered, was watching the BBC news reel, and briefly chatted with the two gents at the bar
    	• The one, older dude, said that he’d officially been to all 50 US states, impresssive! And Hawaii, specifically Kauai was his favorite. Also bummer, one of the bartenders (older gal, coulda been owner or something) asked him about his wife and she’s going through some serious medical issues… :-/
    	• The other guy was middle age-ish and gave me a tip about the North Coast 500 and a story of when he did it, told me about a piping family memorial on the isle of skye, then after the older guy left shifted all the way down the bar, away from me, and that ended any chatter. Kinda weird
    	• Burger was good, messy, but finished up and on my way
    	• Got to the parking lot and didn’t have enough of the right change for parking, so left a note and hoped for the best
    	• Off and up we go!
    	• Start was all kinds a warm and humid through the brush, but eventually got through that and soon after above the tree line and the views were great up and down Loch Lomond
    		○ Why is the tree line so low in Scotland?
    	• Slowly further up, and closer to the clouds. Tried to enjoy the views while they were there
    	• Soon enough up beyond the cloud level and varying levels of reduced visibility
    	• Every now and then a ridge line or other hill would be visible, but not often
    	• Last stretch was steep, but eventually made it and thankfully there was something to signify I’d made it, because there was zero view. White in all directions
    	• Loitered enough to eat a banana then headed down
    	• Bad knees, but kinda zoned out on the way down to the point of giving myself a refresher on geometry. Why.
    	• Back to the car and boom, no issues with the parking ticket
    	• Kinda wasn’t motivated to do anything or go anywhere, so lazily unwound. Had my supermarket snack pack dinner down by the water just taking in the gorgeous views
    	• Hit the road in search of a place to park camp and sleep
    	• Spot one was not as secluded as I hoped
    	• Backtracked and found a spot. Gnight

    2021.09.04
    	• Woke up to an email from Derek with a hint that island life might be shut down on sundays
    	• Shit, check the whiskey tours!
    		○ Bowmore, loses sun mon and only tour available id have to bust ass to make it on time. Face
    		○ Bunnahabhain - tours avail
    		○ Laphroaig - shop open no tours avail
    		○ Lagavulin - tour confirmed 05.09
    		○ Bruichladdich - no tours in September
    		○ Ardbeg - closed sun mon, maybe open?
    		○ Ardnahoe - tour confirmed 04.09
    		○ Caol Ila - closed, available at Lagavulin
    		○ Kilchoman - closed sun mon
    	• Bummed, and a good bit upset thinking my goal of enjoying the Islay Whiskey potpourri might be in jeopardy
    	• Packed up and hit the road opting for finding a spot along the way to eat my breakfast
    	• Found that spot on the other side of Loch Lomond. Easy breakfast with bread pbj and a banana. Good time to calm down think things through and ride the wave. Nothings perfect and shit happens, gotta deal with it with a level head
    	• Back on the road, more Shantaram and trying to enjoy the scenery. Too many trees covering the roadway which made the latter hard
    	• Got to Arrochar on the way to Thr ferry and hit the loo and did some looking up. This time remembering there’s a ferry required to even get to Islay
    	• As luck would have it, no ferries from that place on the day. Only one with space was out of Oban
    	• Had to cancel (rebook after deliberation) the one tour I’d booked and do a u-turn to head to Oban instead
    	• Quite the change in plans, but at least I had a spot on the ferry…
    	• On the way, made another pit stop to take it easy, think things through, and do some planning
    	• Got a request from Ardnahoe if I wanted to cancel or reschedule. Tough to say, because I wanted to leave Islay on Monday, but they didn’t open up til Tuesday
    	• After some deliberation, I went against the original plan and opted for leaving the island on Tuesday. Opting for a more relaxed pace, taking it slow and easy, and making sure I didn’t rush myself. And the benefit was more whiskey experiences. But honestly the biggest pull was forcing myself to take it slower and at a more relaxed pace. I’m on vacation for peat’s sake
    	• Cue the introduction to a delightfully inquisitive little bird
    	• Got curious and shocked me the first time he flew up and sat on the window sill
    	• Not wanting to scare him off, and wanting to see how trusting he was, I stuck out my finger to see if he’d use it as a perch
    	• Never did, but worked his way up to the side mirror, and then back to the window sill
    	• A bit of a game of cat and mouse as I shuffled in my chair and he came in and out of view. Pretty little bird and a nice little Companion to tell me to cool down and enjoy what comes
    	• Eventually put in a call to get a campsite on Islay, got my ferry off the island booked, and a bit more planning for my whiskey fun while on the island. Things were coming together with that little birds help
    	• Kept driving, wanting to get food before the tasting at Oban, so stopped at a smokehouse sign I saw along the road
    	• Good place, maybe went a little overboard with salmon cheeses and more
    	• Snagged a toastie of ham and smoked cheddar (aka grilled cheese), it was delicious, then back on the road to get to Oban on time
    	• Cool coming into town from the desolate nature to a pretty hopping harbor and touristy destination
    	• Parked right out front the distillery, which was right in the heart of downtown on the water
    	• Eventually got started with Jim the lively salesman of a Glaswegian and two other parties from the US
    	• The experience was a little less personal than at Glengoyne, but some delicious whiskey to taste and learn about.
    	• Some new info:
    		○ Whiskey Must be aged at least three years to be called whiskey
    		○ Whiskey Must be at least 40% ABV to be called whiskey
    		○ the Angel’s Share (the whiskey lost to evaporation during maturation) is an actual taxable quantity
    		○ The four (I thought 5) whiskey regions of Scotland, and what each region tends to taste like
    	• Oban is definitely a different whiskey than some others I know. Good, but not quite my alley
    	• Good little tasting experience, and got a free tasting glass to go with it. Dope
    	• From there, got some midgee spray then off to the ferry
    	• The guy at the booth turned me around saying I was way too early. Bummer
    	• Strove towards out of town and ended up stopping at Lidl to stock up on grub
    	• Got grub and ice and filled the cooler, ended up giving the extra ice to some folks in a vanagan
    	• Went and parked with the plan to walk around town

    	• A
    	• Oban felt like Bergen
    	• Mid-stop island on the ferry, would love to have a reason to go there, find a house to rent on a stormy week, and just post up, maybe for romantic reasons, and just cozy in at a house so inaccessible and far from everything


    2021.09.05
    	• Lagavulin
    		○ 2017 jazz fest cask
    		○ 12 year cask
    		○ Aggressive use of the peat, enough for 100k years…
    		○ 2021 jazz fest cask, 13yr triple maturation
    		○ Distillery exclusive bottle
    		○ Mill in the Hollow (La’ Vulin)
    		○ Single Cask sample (random sample)
    			§ Hard to get, likely only at distilleries
    	• Islay wildlife
    		○ Almost running over a bunny thr first night on the way to the campsite
    		○ Getting scared shirtless by a pheasant as I was less than a stride away from it
    		○ Seeing bunnies, a deer, more pheasants or grouse, and a hawk with its prey on the drive out of the lighthouse
    	• Full day on the small (but actually big) island
    	• Breakfast and shower, easy, nice start to the day
    	• Off to Lagavulin with a stop to fail at getting ice along the way
    	• Lagavulin, see above
    	• From there, off on an adventure
    	• First to thr castle right out front of lagavulin’s little bay
    	• Ended up being an archaeological team from University of Reading excavating thr castle to discover its history. How cool! That was their third dig season, and on the first they discovered a crest housed in the museum, gotta check that out
    	• Got some cool pictures, infatuated with two boats on the shore, and climbed around the castle for a bit. Cool stuff
    	• From there, drove out to the end of the road. Or at least the end on the SE corner of the island
    	• Thought there was a trail, there was at least on the map, so went for it. Goal - lighthouse
    	• Turns out the trail has not been maintained in a godawfully long time, or thr trail is a conglomeration of tractor paths that never get used
    	• Either way, majority of thr trek was bushwhacking
    	• Got to the first ridge with the majority of the route in view and was ready to just turn around. It seemed too far, didn’t want to bushwhack, and meh
    	• Checked the duration on maps.me and it said an hour. Gut call and went for it
    	• Went faster than I thought
    	• Got down from the ridge to skirt the beaches, and crazy just how desolate and empty (not the right word) yet immense the landscape was
    	• Purple bushes and their flowers mixed with the yellows and greens of the grass made for some beautiful colors and color palates
    	• Got to the beach, bookmarked the first spot for a chill out on the return trip
    	• Motored on, better going along the water. Very Rocky beach
    	• Came up to an abandoned house, or a former wilderness shelter. Could be either. But there were some building ruins next to the non ruins, coulda been anything
    	• Either way, the buildings made a wonderful prop in the pictures. Desolate landscape with abandoned building. Picturesque
    	• Kept plugging and got to the end of the beaches, now time to ascend the ridge to get up and over the cliff
    	• Not a ton of up, but it was a slog with the bushwhacking
    	• Tons of cerns and sticker bushes
    	• A good number of false summits, but eventually got to the point where I could see the lighthouse!
    	• Always called it good and just turned around, but dropped my pack, grabbed my camera, and hiked down to the lighthouse
    	• Was in a weirdly fenced in area, went around one side and dead ended, then other side to get in
    	• Fully automated lighthouse, saw the banks of batteries inside and the solar panels up top
    	• Loitered around the lighthouse for a bit, then back up to my bag
    	• Before leaving, popped a squat in the grass and bush
    	• Serenely beautiful spot
    		○ In a sparsely populated country
    		○ On a remote and sparsely populated island
    		○ Past the end of the road
    		○ A good 2 hour hike in
    		○ On a hillside overlooking the ocean
    		○ No one around, and for someone to get to me, it’s an easy multiple hour journey
    		○ Nothing but the wind and the rustling of the grass
    	• Really a gorgeous and remote spot, but the bug in my head kept annoying me telling me I could t/shouldn’t hang out too long
    	• Really annoying thing in the back of my head
    	• Did my best to enjoy it, but hit the road back, way before I wanted to
    	• Bushwhacking down the cliff was way easier than coming up, soon enough back down to the beach
    	• Super white and find sand at the beach, kinda cool
    	• Wandered down the beach, back past the house, and to the rain checked beach
    	• Got there and went into a lounge, quite comfy, quite remote, and quite relaxing
    	• Slowly, a couple rain drops. Then slightly picked up
    	• Wasn’t gonna let rain ruin my quiet time, so rain jacket, pans, and pack cover, and I was rain-proofed and still sitting there
    	• Similar feeling to before. Remote and relaxing
    	• Same bug as before though too, and didn’t stAy as long as I would’ve like
    	• Trucking and whacking on back
    	• Took a couple better turns and skipped a. If hill
    	• Got scared shitlrss from a pheasant who waited til I was a single stride away to scream out of the bush it was hiding I
    	• Had to jump a fence and then back over,  it found my way out of there
    	• Pretty wet by the time I was out
    	• Got to Rupert, de-rain geared, and got warmed back up
    	• Nommmed on a cookie. I love cookies
    	• Then the slow trek back
    	• Stopped in Port Ellen to get breakfast stuff
    	• Indian food for dinner, it was ok. Guy was a little cagey if they had space for me,  it it all worked out
    	• UK roads are absolute shit. Super bumpy auf rutty and full of puddles and bumps, fuck. Terrible quality regardless of where or what.
    	• Tire pressure light came on likely because of that
    	• After dinner, pooped. Not a crazy busy day, but still long and very cool
    	• On my own, not good about thinking about things, deliberating. Have a huge decision to make, and have so far taken little to no time to think it over. So focused on the trip and what to do and what to plan, that I haven’t given myself the space to contemplate my choice outside of some cursory moments. Leaning towards extending though


    2021.09.06

    	• Earlier start than I expected, but good to go
    	• Café wouldn’t let me eat my breakfast inside, so bummed around the car and auch
    	• After commiserating on whether to stay in Germany or not to so many people and over so many months, I finally gave my decision.
    	• Waking up to a message from my boss asking for an update for HR, I kinda knew it was about time to give an answer on the situation. I am bad at deliberating on things on my own, and haven’t taken time to think it over during this trip. Despite that, I’d already been tending toward a direction, and in that call, gave my boss the agreement that I’ll sign on for another two years and see how long I actually make it.
    	• Not an easy decision, and still not convinced it’s the right decision. But it’s the decision I’ve made, and now need to stand by it and make the most out of what comes from it.
    	• Eventually started my trip over to Bunnahabhain
    	• Easy drive; then on the single lane road to the distillery
    	• Truck oncoming, so I backed up to what I thought was a lay away
    	• Turns out, back into a ditch. Fuck me
    	• Called the distillery, they told me to head back down the road to the previous house/farm/bnb and talk to a guy named Wilf to pull me out
    	• Ran over, jogged, because I didn’t want to miss out on. The tasting
    	• No one in the courtyard, empty, called some numbers and no answer
    	• Walked over to the door for enquirers, opened it, and barged in on thr mr and mrs as they were packing to head to the ferry. Felt like a dick
    	• But talked to Ronald, aka Wilf, and asked if he could help
    	• Told me to start walking back and he’s come over to take a look
    	• Walked back, worried I’d be left high and dry
    	• Soon as I was back to the car, he rolled up with his tractor. Bing bang boom and I was out. Easy as pie. Super nice gentleman to help. Gave him something in thanks and told him I’d come by Persabus next time I’m on the island for a drink with him
    	• Rupert removed from the ditch, I was off to the distillery
    	• Got in, helped by a wonderful man named Colin and led into the warehouse for thr tasting
    	• Easily the coolest experience this far, tasting in the maturation warehouse with casks all around and sitting in church pews with Rodney leading us through the tasting
    	• Missed the first dram but made it for the last three, great tastes and whiskies
    	• Bunnahabhain
    		○ Missed manzanita 54.2, 2008
    		○ Pedro Ximenez Noe - 51.2, 2004
    		○ #3 cask unknown - 45.5%
    		○ Dunnagh warehouse (dunnagh, type of location, mold blood sweat whiskey maturation)
    		○ Avg angels share 1.5%
    		○ #4 moine PX 2004, 7 yr cask finish, 52.8%
    	• After the tasting, bumming around the shop with the rest of the tasting crew
    	• Got the insider scoop to try the 18yr, and then a different one
    	• Chatted with James and his friend and their wives about Scotland
    	• Tip to hike Beinn Alligin near Torridan, thenInverness, and the Falkirk wheel and the Kelpies, all great tips!!!
    	• They seemed like a fun bunch, first vacation in a while without their kids, and off to golf later
    	• Got myself a yummy bottle, the fourth from the tasting, and ran into issues with my camera, it wouldn’t turn on,,, :-(
    	• All good with thr camera, just Uber dead batteries
    	• After the tasting, felt a bit quite aimless, just Unrushed to do anything
    	• So I pulled off the road overlooking thr bay with Bowmore across the way, whipped out my chair, and celebrated with some smoked mussels (absofuckinglutely delicious) and some pretzel goldfish (kinda meh) while looking out on the calm bay on a grey and breezy day
    	• Had a nice relaxing time sitting there, and was feeling a nap coming on
    	• But rather than nap, I stopped off at the Museum of Islay Life to get a little more history on the place
    	• Tons of cool artifacts and neat information on the island and it’s people
    	• A few interesting connections to the US - sunken ships and immigration the main ones
    	• Saw the crest that was dug up by the archaeology crew! Tiny medallion
    	• Cool museum visit then back to the campground
    	• Bummed around, read, then took a nap I. Thr car because it was raining and didn’t want to move from my reading chair
    	• Pretty damn good car nap, got a good hour or so it felt like. Needed that for sure
    	• Took a while to find the motivation, but up and motored over to Portnhaven
    	• Went there for food at a place, but parked, chatted with an old lady sitting at her doorstep, and rather than going straight for food, grabbed my camera and lens and did a walk about
    	• Gorgeous little port town. Quiet, gentle harbor nestled behind two small islands. A very sheltered alcove and perfect for a harbor
    	• Walked around, saw two old ladies doing a relaxed water aerobics thing in the sound, took some pics of thr boats and birds and deer and seals, and got in a nice little meander
    	• On the far side, plopped on a bench looking in the direction of Ireland and enjoyed the view and calm sea air
    	• On the circle back to town, popped onto a bench overlooking thr harbor
    	• Some point two bike tourists rose into town, so I chatted with thr two Glaswegian for a good bit. Seemed like two nice fellows
    	• Popped down to the bar - closed. Goddamnit
    	• Went and sat by the water for a bit. But went back and thr bar was definitely closed. Bummer
    	• Back to thr campground, got a delicious wrap and a beer, ate and drank, kinda got my car situated and such, then off to bed
    	• Notes on Islay
    		○ All/most buildings are painted white with the trim being the accent color. There predominantly black
    		○ Likely more sheep than people
    		○ A jeep wave, but with everyone
    		○ Didn’t matter how many times I drove a stretch, seemed like a new route every time

    2021.09.07
    	• Ferry, car alarms go off after the engines start churning
    	• Corned beef, Blech. Not for me
    	• Unicorn is the official animal of Scotland, Lion that of Britain

    	• Woke up to the tent next to me having a loud fireside chat starting at 6am. Wtf
    	• Rolled around for a while, then eventually got up
    	• Showered and cleaned up, then packed all up. Wet rain fly was just gonna have to dry before fully packing it up
    	• Motored out on a foggy but nice morning and over to Bowmore to the CoOp, groceries for thr day, including breakfast
    	• From there, motored back on down south to the American Memorial
    	• Helluva windy, rutty, single file road. Quite the ride
    	• Stopped along the way for a few pictures and eventually made it to the parking lot
    	• Parked, made and ate some breakfast, then figured it’s be more of a hike so put on my boots
    	• Started off along a little dirt road and then bam, cliffs and an incredible view with some highland cattle thrown in
    	• Seriously, what a gorgeous view
    	• Found a bench and tried to take it all in, with the fog rolling over the peaks, the incredible cliffs at varying levels, and the waves just keeping on keeping on
    	• Got up, went to another vantage point to view, then from there continued on trying to keep my head pointed at the view without falling off thr cliff
    	• The walk continued up and around thr bend
    	• But with thr cliff view remaining visible for a good while
    	• Eventually came to a different cliff view, this one with thr monument on top. Incredible drop from the monument down
    	• Crept close to the edge, great incredible views
    	• Something at th bottom near the water kept making a noise, thought it was a seal or something, but couldn’t get a glimpse of whatever was crying out
    	• Slowly made my way over to the monument. Incredible structure for a harrowing remembrance
    	• Can’t imagine having a troop transport ship crash in that spot in the middle of winter and trying to survive. My goodness
    	• Incredible views, and now able to look across the inlet to Portnhaben, where I was last night. Not able to make anything out, but it was there
    	• Gorgeous hike, way more to it than what I anticipated and really happy I went and did it. Bummed I didn’t have more time
    	• From there, back to town
    	• Got to Bowmore, ate a croissant and an apple at The harbor to kill time
    	• Then to the distillery, had to wait out front for someone to collect us
    	• But got collected and waited a hot second for Lynn to come and get us, me and a British couple for thr tasting
    	• Whiskey and chocolate, quite the good pairing
    	• Wasn’t super blown away by any of the pairings. What I can say, white chocolate destroyed the whiskey. Tasted good before, tasted bland as hell after the white chocolate. Never again…
    	• Lynn was super nice, but felt like she was pandering to the British couple most of the time. Not intentional, I’m of the quiet and non-attention-Hoggy nature, so that always happens
    	• First thing we tried was the liquid before it gets mature. Interesting trick to douse it on your hand like rubbing alcohol, run your hands together to burn off the alcohol, then smell what’s left. Smells like the malting process!!! Yummy!!!
    	• Got done with our three prescribed tastes, and then got to try the David Simpson 20yr. Now that one was good. She said it was her favorite, and I can see why. Unfortunately a little too expensive for me
    	• Got to try their vault edition, and that was ok, but not spectacular. Great to try it though, because the sun was fully out at that point and we had to taste them on the patio. Not bad
    	• Ended up not getting a bottle. Surprised myself, but nothing stood out
    	• Thanked Lynn, great and fun host
    	• Then off to walk a bit around town and snap a few pics
    	• Felt a little aimless and unmotivated, so got some coffee and a shrimp sandwich and ate it by the water. Was literally just shrimp salad thrown on bread, but tasted fantastic
    	• A
    	• Got off the ferry and was ready to drive
    	• Shantaram getting to a few good spots, so had something to keep me going
    	• Once I passed the slow cars it was green lights and clear pavement. Gotta say, Acotlanf is a drivers paradise with clear roads. Curvy, engaging. Dynamic, pretty damn awesome place to drive
    	• Had a good clip and was in a good zone
    	• Got close enough to Glencoe that I called it good and turned off, conveniently where google maps said the Skyfall mountain scene took place. Pretty cool
    	• Milky Way before midnight. Got to a parking spot to sleep just in time to enjoy the Milky Way for a while before the clouds rollled in. Out in full glory, dark sky night. What a beautiful sight

    2021.08.09
    	• A
    	• Amazing nap at the top of the valley. Such a beautiful spot looking down the U shape to a small mountain then a big one behind it. Just gorgeous
    	• Took my time enjoying that view. Such a peaceful situation with nothing but nature
    	• Then slowly started the way down that valley. Kinda slow going, lots of big and a very poorly defined trail, but made it happen
    	• Another dude came up behind me outta nowhere. Thought I was the only one on that trail. Not anymore
    	• Got to the end of The Valley and thought I’d have an easy stroll back to the car. Checked the map, 11km to go. Goddamnmotherfucker
    	• Maps had me take the way less trodden route up and over a big hill and I was getting eaten alive by the damn flying spider things the whole time. Not about it, and souring fast
    	• Was a ways til the next chance to hit the road and try my luck, but luckily enough there was a random bridge that popped up so it took it and hit the road
    	• Car passes as soon as I got out there, damn, so started walking/jogging down the road
    	• Passed by a van, no dice, but the sedan afterward of Anna the hiking guide and her two friends gave me a lift!!’ Hot damn!!! My life (aka 2 hours and 5mi of walking) was saved!!!
    	• Lovely chat with the ladies til they got dropped off, then talked with Anna the rest of the way. Talked with her about how to become a hiking guide. Don’t have any teaching experience, and my patience is not the best, but maybe that’s something for me?
    	• Super stoked to be back at Rupert. Man. Nice to take the boots off
    	• Went and “showered” in the river to try and get as much sweat off my body as possible. I was feeling gross
    	• On the way out, there were two folks looking to hitch back to town, so I gave them a lift. Pay it forward
    	• Nice couple from Ireland, said to bring/have a car for traveling around their country. Sounds good
    	• Super friendly folks, and I dropped them downtown
    	• Headed to a parking spot and wanted to hit up a bar. Pizza and beer on my mind
    	• First place no dice, second no dice, fuck it, don’t wanna spend all night on a goose chase
    	• The Irish folks’ recommendation it was and I snagged me a chicken tikka Marsala pizza then went to Tesco and got a beer then drove to the waterfront parking lot. Camp chair out, pizza on my lap and cold beer in the cup holder. Fuck yeah

    2021.09.09
    	• Up and at em, reorganized my bags a bit
    	• Breakfast at JJ’s Café. Went with the British breakfast
    		○ Beans, tried em and hell no
    		○ Black pudding was some kinda hockey puck thing, it was ok
    		○ Sausage tasted a little funky
    		○ Ham was salty as hell
    		○ And there was some kind of meaty bread loaf thing. Pretty ok
    		○ Enjoyed what I could of that and smashed the bread and coffee
    	• Food at Aldi, can’t buy beer before 10am either. What the hell scotland. Had a good stout and porter selected and was looking forward to em.,.
    	• Off to the Nevis Range (Fort William) Bike park. COMMENCE STOKEAGE!!!
    	• Got in, couldn’t buy passes until the gondola started, oh well, so filled up my water bottles and auch and got ready
    	• But of a drizzle before things even started, but nothing I couldn’t enjoy!!!
    	• In line and up we Go, weird way to hang the bikes but let’s do this!
    	• Top Chief black run to warm up. Rocks like woah. And uphill. Pretty decent trail though once it started going down
    	• Stopped 2/3 down and jogged over to Qitch’s Goat. Awesome little trail of rocky berms through the trees, weaving in out and around everything. Fun
    	• Now, on to the big shit. WORLD CUP DOWNHILL!!! Got super stoked on the gondola ride up
    	• Got my girl’s puc with the starting hit, then had a couple hikers in the booth to ‘cheer’ me on to start
    	• Holy shit what a trail. Such a great mix of everything! Some really rocky bits, blows my mind how the pros can just croooooose right on through them
    	• Crazy how the pros can do this in 4ish minutes, took me over 10min, not including a crash and a couple breaks. Damn those dudes can rip!!!
    	• Already pretty beat; after just two runs. The hike yesterday might not have been the best prep. But here we are!!!
    	• Back to the lift line and had a lovely chat with an energetic lift worker
    	• Asked me about thr trails, my bike, where I’m from, and he was just all kinds of super friendly. Love the positivity and fun!!!!!
    	• Gave the new blue one a try. Supposed to be flown and bermy, but didn’t get that vibe. The berms either didn’t seem to be tall enough or I wasn’t comfortable enough laying into the really low berms. That and a lot of pedaling. Couldn’t find a groove.
    	• Back to Witch’s goat, that’s a fun one
    	• Lunch time. Chowed on my Aldi soggy wrap, had a banana, and read a chapter of my book. Quite the laid back lunch break :-)
    	• After another World Cup run (crashed in the same spot… easy stuff but couldn’t conquer that spot), chatted with two dudes from NW Britain. They, as me, don’t have anything like this near home, so it’s a treat to get to ride this stuff. They’re headed to Glencoe soon, and a scot nearby tipped in and confirmed that Laggan is a great place to ride, so I’m glad it’s on the list!
    	• Went back up for a Top Chief lap, and outside of the sling wooden plank ride (I hate the combo of wood and rain, makes me uneasy regardless of how wide the path is…) loved the run. Rocks all over the place felt like a math problem that I was nailing the whole way down. Then Withs goat again. Short but what a sweet bermy trail winding through trees
    	• Got back to the bottom and a quick word with the dudes who lent me their pump and the chat from earlier, I grabbed my camp chair and joined them at their flan
    	• Chris and Damien, on the annual voyage to Fort William, nice to hang and chat with them. Good (I guess) to hear that Covid a in the same state with them, as with elsewhere in the world, but they’re getting through it. Also learned after my ignorant question that a quid is the exact same thing as a pound, neither we’re sure where quod came from
    	• Had a nice chat with them, then broke off for the next run (they seemed to be and are much better riders than me), but after coming out of the loo they pulled right into the lift line so we shared a gondola up
    	• Nice chats along the way, then I was toying with doing another World Cup run, but they opted for Top Chief, so I decided to join them for this one and come back up for another World Cup
    	• Top Chief was unbelievably foggy. The rain had kept coming, so it was a little wetter (although the rocks were still super grumpy which was unheard of but awesome), and the fog held visibility down to what felt like no more than 20-30ft. It was dense
    	• Worked through the wood section and the uphill, and then the downhill. That’s when I learned I was poooooped. Legs were a bit tired, but my hands and arms were limp fishing and ready to be done
    	• Another fun lap on top Chief and then to witch’s goat, which again, was a blast. Might’ve been my favorite run. But really, all of them were incredible outside of the blue one
    	• Pooped after an incredible day of riding at an incredible place, time to slowly tear off all the wet and dirty gear
    	• Chris and Damien let me use their hand held pressure washer (and I forgot to explicitly thank them for that, big regret) which was way cool. I hope desalt make something like that
    	• Slowly got all my stuff laid out in the car to dry and make super smell like a high school locker room, then said adios to Chris and Damien as they drove off, and heard into the café for a cap and snack
    	• Annoyed that drip coffe isn’t a thing in Scotland
    	• Got my coffee and scone and headed to the patio
    	• Was gonna jump on wifi to look at weather and plan and such, but no wifi on the patio meant lay back and relax
    	• There were some skid fish birds searching for crumbs and all kept an eye on me
    	• Scone was way better with butter than with jam
    	• Coffee was pretty good too
    	• Drank and ate it all slowly and enjoyable, watching the trees and the chairlift so their thing
    	• Eventually finished, I snuck back inside with a little coffee left to do my research and planning
    	• Was kinda bummed and feeling a little unlucky and pouty because the forecast was bad for the next couple days regardless of what I was looking to do - that’s Scotland, and I knew and prepared for that coming into it - but it still kinda got me down
    	• A little bummed, I paid and left the parking lot and as a first step forced myself to get some groceries. As I’ve learned, just take that first step to get things rolling
    	• Back to the Aldi to not go to Aldi because they didn’t have a bakery, so went to the swanky-ass M&S Trader Joe’s type place next door
    	• Grabbed my bananas and they were all empty at their bakery. No use paying a premium when what I was going for wasn’t available.
    	• Around this time noticed that the second crash hurt my knee a good bit
    	• Googled and found a co-op (which I’ve found to be pretty reliable as they’ve got extended opening hours, and people on Islay were raving about them as well) and headdd over there
    	• No English muffins anywhere on the shelves, I’m in England for Christ’s sake
    	• Snagged enough to get by and then felt aimless and targetless again
    	• Tended towards starting to make my way in the direction of Isle of Skye, but by way of the non-highway road to start
    	• Doing so took me by Neptune’s staircase, so I decided to stop in
    	• Chowed on my sandwich to start, then off on a little walk
    	• What a cool spot. Throughout my slow journey, I learned that I was driving through what’s known as the Great Glen Way. Essentially a natural straight line from East to west coast of Scotland with a few lakes along the way caused by a fault like collision between two prehistoric continents way the hell back when
    	• Well, 1800s Scotland said they needed a canal to connect the two coasts and by golly they did it, and Neptune’s staircase was the west-end of the canal and a series of 7 locks along the canal right near the town of Fort William
    	• So I walked the length of the locks and got some pictures and was in pretty clear awe of the swinging bridges
    	• Rather than tilting up or opening or what it like other river bridges; this one (and one later) just spins/twists out of the way. How cool!!!
    	• Cool, gorgeous walk in the grey around the locks. Pretty cool spot and great stop
    	• Continued on the non-highway road on my way, and fun curvy winding Scottish road
    	• Crossed theother swunfing bridge at the other end; then stopped off at a commando memorial commemorating the lost commandos in WWII and afterwards
    	• Beautiful setting for a memorial, and gorgeous views of the landscapes with clouds hanging around and being gorgeous
    	• Onward journey, and damn, empty Scottish highways (this one was in great condition surprisingly) are fun as hell to drive. Just kinda got in the zone and was really enjoying it
    	• Stopped off again on an overlook at Loch Lochy (piecing it together means Lake Lakey, like a four year old named it…)
    	• Then cut over, continued enjoyment of driving
    	• In and out of clouds and fog and bummed I couldn’t see the full view of what I was driving through
    	• Eventually found myself driving through a major valley and knew I had to pull off and camp soon, just so I could hopefully see the drive in better light in the morning
    	• Eventually saw a Kong road cutting across The Valley and took it
    	• Gorgeous spot from what I could see in the low light. Really looking forward to a hopefully clearer and brighter view in the morning. Feeling of beautiful desolation
    	• Got some things reorganized, then grabbed my chair with my Bowmore 18-yr dram and sat with a dusky view
    	• Somewhere in there in the very low light saw a couple of deer jaunting across The Valley
    	• Then, bedtime

    2021.09.10
    	• Up and at em, early again.
    	• No breakfast, but cloudy and fairly gloomy with a beautiful landscape
    	• Got squared away, snapped some pics, then hit the road
    	• No timeline or clear destination; so took it slow and enjoyed the road
    	• Took a few stops to enjoy the sights, and one longer one to get a good view of an sweet castle right on the water. Must have been quite the incredible spot in its hayday
    	• Slowly rambled on and soon enough bud crossed the bridge (which is younger than me by 5yrs) and was on the Isle of Skye!
    	• Unfortunately and weirdly, I was a little aimless and unsure what to do because of the weather. Knew rain was forecast and didn’t want to get poured on, so wasn’t set on jumping into any one thing
    	• Topped off the tank and tried to get a plan, and then decided to drive out to the end of the first offshoot road from the highway. Elgol here we come
    	• Beautiful drive out there. Slow, with a few spots with sheep and cattle on the roadway
    	• Got out to Elgol and used the loo, and saw the monstrous old Arocs that was converted into a mega 6x6 off-roading motor home. Didn’t get a good pic, but I saw it on Islay and damn that things a beast!
    	• Was at the overlook and drove down to the harbor (steep roadways, would interest me to see how they cope in the winter!), and from the view was blown away by the mountains across the sound
    	• So with that as a starting point, I started looking on the map for hiking trails
    	• Sure enough, pieced together what I thought would be a good loop
    	• No time to waste, back in the car and off to the trailhead!
    	• Unfortunately the road from the main road wasn’t a road but a hiking trail; so add 2mi each way to get to/from the loop I’d scoped, but either way, here we go!
    	• The hike in was meh, but passed a friendly group (assumed mom dad and daughter) and had a nice chat with them. They mentioned the Danny MacAskill video where he’s on Skye, gotta watch it again. Nice bunch, jealous they were headed to Talisker for a tasting that day
    	• Motored on down the hill and entered the first amphitheater. A couple buildings on the pasture right at the beach with incredible mountains growing up behind them. Gorgeous
    	• Made it down to the plain and motored across it, going by the old building, and saying hi to the older couple snacking at the hut.
    	• From there, needed to cross the river. Didn’t want to take my boots off so fording wasn’t on the table. Had to backtrack up the river to find a spot with enough rocks and did. Success!
    	• Now for out and around the peninsula
    	• Trail went up a bit, and I got to say hi to four seals from above as they were lounging to the max
    	• Continued on the trail with a few kayakers on the Water and entered the second amphitheater with the two Lochs and essentially an incredible bay
    	• Scrambled around, sat for a while and waved to the kayakers and boaters (damn tourist boats) before making my way to the Bad Step
    	• This was something talked about on a few sites, but a giant rock feature you had to maneuver to keep going
    	• A little sketchy, but really not that bad
    	• Got through there, greeted some kayakers on the beach and entered amphitheater 3. Super gorgeous. A lake just inside the bay, found a rock slab and got super comfy lounging around and admiring the incredible and intense rock structures all around
    	• From there could see the trail I needed to ascend, so after a cat nap I got in my way
    	• Up up up to a little bowl along the after fall
    	• Trails here are just choose your own adventure for the most part and just bogs. Soaked
    	• Didn’t take too long to get to the bowl with a higher lane for amphitheater 4. Pretty, but pushed on to get to the top of the ridgeway insane to see how many gigantic boulders, each weighing a good 2-20 tons, looked to be testing in such a precarious spot that a mere toothpick was the only thing preventing them from rolling all the way down. Pretty nuts
    	• Also kinda pushed to the top because of the midges and jumping spiders
    	• Damn, peaked the ridge and another gorgeous amphitheater
    	• Sat for a bit, then got the seventh ridge which blew me away.
    	• Able to see down a super long Valley, to the highway essentially, and one super relaxed drawn out foothill just putting such a gorgeous natural line on the whole thing. Really mesmerizing
    	• Whipped out my pretzel goldfish and chowed on them while admiring the view before finding another spot to lounge on a comfy rock and catnap. Gorgeous spot
    	• Eventually up and headdd down, decided to cut the flat to save about a mile and jut straight to the trail headed back
    	• Unfortunately the wind stopped and I got nothing but mauled, Midges everywhere and jumping spiders. Sheesh. I tried not to spot, reapplied my bug spray, and the damn things were still constantly attacking
    	• Entered the last amphitheater but didn’t take too much time to watch because of the midges
    	• Decided on a connector trail to cut off some miles, but the trail was damn near invisible
    	• Tried to keep with it, and eventually it got me to the main trail and out
    	• At the junction, chatted with some hikers from Wales, they were happy to see someone else on the trail
    	• I was itching to be done and take my boots off, so said adios and got my normal speed in gear up the hill and on the way
    	• Unfortunately I ran completely dry of energy and the last bit was a slog
    	• The folks caught up To me, so the chat as we walked back helped me out
    	• Got a suggestion for Skye from them, then bud them adieu
    	• Got packed up, and thought about camping there for the night, but decided against to head back to the big valley around thr corner
    	• It started drizzling there as I pulled up, so pushed a bit further and found a spot
    	• Got set up, made some food, and hit the sack

    2021.09.11
    	• Slept like shit. Windy all night and was a worried about my bike, and rainy as hell so had to play with the windows
    	• Didn’t get much sleep, but eventually got all readjusted to get a move on
    	• Back toward town, hit the loo, filled up on water, and then grabbed some breakfast because I was too lazy to make a pb and bagel
    	• On the road. Grey morning, but quiet and serene
    	• A couple scenic stops, then first longer stop was the Eas a Bhradain waterfall. Huge, impressive, super swampy, and rushes of water flowing likely due to the previous night’s rain
    	• Water was a real brown, maybe the iron in the rocks?
    	• Wandered around there, and snapped some pictures of the fish farms in that bay. Big nets/cafes(?) of fishies
    	• Motored on, stopped at a monument for a couple Scottish mountaineers, then on the road toward the fairy pools
    	• Saw the fairy pools aka a group of waterfalls on the drive, and opted for heading again to the end of the road
    	• Got there, pulled out my camp chair and just sat on the beach
    		○ Kind of an off-axis wave pattern, with two lines of them intersecting
    		○ A couple groups of birds hanging around
    		○ The tiny ones were super agile in the air. Got to see a couple go after each other and it was my dynamic than a dogfight. Cool stuff
    	• Nice and relaxing just watching the birds and trying to let it all go
    	• Eventually, back in the car and off we go
    	• Nixed the fairy pools, wasn’t too intrigued by it
    	• Continued on down the road and looked at the map. Turns out, Talisker distillery was close by so I figured that was a sign to head over!
    	• Talisker distillery
    		○ No tours, obv
    		○ Chatted with the guy at the gate for a bit, friendly guy, good suggestions on the whiskey
    		○ Grabbed my puffy and a book and did a tasting flight
    		○ Free chocolates!!! Whaddup
    		○ Rather than buying at the bar, went in to the shop
    		○ Standing in line, loved the smell next to the distillery, mixture of salt water and malt. Fantastic
    		○ Snagged a bottle and had a really friendly chat with thr cashier. Super bubbly and nice
    	• Took a few pics in town as it started to rain and then hit the road and off we went
    	• Took the road back to the main road and headed north toward dunvegan
    	• Was getting hungry, and spotted a seafood food truck in dunvegan. Zeroed in and here we go
    	• Of course, was closed. Wasn’t even sure if it existed…
    	• Torn, didn’t want to look up food options, and since the weather was decent I decided to drive out to another end of the road and venture over there
    	• Turns out, yet again, the best decision
    	• Headed over to Neist Point, essentially because there was a lighthouse, but also way much more
    	• The Drive in opened my eyes to some huge cliffs right on the water, I got excited!!! Parked, smashed a bagel down my throat, and was on the hunt for tranquility
    	• Found a spot in the cow pasture overlooking thr water. Got to enjoy it for a bit before some douchebag with a drone ruined it
    		○ I HATE drones in nature. It completely kills the vibe
    		○ Just like asshats who bring speakers on a hike
    		○ Sure, must be fun and enjoyable for you, but can’t you see that that shitty noise and thing is pretty ducking annoying
    		○ Background - for me when I’m in nature or around something nature, I want it to be just that - nature. As little or No human influence or trace whatsoever. That’s what I strive for whenever I find a spot to post up and take it all in. Nothing but natural sights, natural sounds, and natural things to sense in every way. So when people start throwing drones and music and god knows what else around, it kills it for me and pisses me off (probably more than it should, but here we are…)
    	• Got up and motored on, and got onto the trail to head down to the tower and lighthouse and such
    	• Man, there kept being more and more to this place!
    	• Wandered up the big hill and enjoyed the views, great in all directions
    	• Then headed down and over the next bump and wandered over to an old crane that was decommissioned. Cool to see the layers of rust and how, assuming my due to proximity to the sea, the steel was literally just flaking away
    	• From there, wandered down the jetty and found my solitude. Beautiful views, wind blowing, watching seagulls dive bomb the water, the kelp ebbing and flowing. Peaceful. Gorgeous
    	• Eventually motored over to the lighthouse, checked it out, then made my way back up
    	• Hard being in a place like that where you never lose sight of the sights, walking is hard because I don’t want to watch where I’m going
    	• Back to the car, a few more deep breaths and deep stares, and on the road
    	• Back to Dunvegan, and needed to eat. Stopped at a place called The Old School, likely because it was the old school building
    	• No spots inside, so ordered up, grabbed my beer and water, and out to the patio
    	• Started to drizzle, and there were some midges about, but I was relaxing
    	• Food was up! Snagged it and holy shit deliciousness
    	• Scallops with chorizo over cous cous. Zomfg, that with a blue cheese salad. Fucking yummy!!!
    	• Enjoyed the hell out of that meal, was definitely in my food happynzone doing my food happy dance
    	• From there, motored on and wanted to go see a recommendation, a memorial cairn for a piping clan. Drove down to the end of the road to where the trail starts, but at the start of the trail there were no parking signs everywhere… hemmed and hawed, wanted to check it out, but dusk was coming quick and I was tired. Vetoed it and motored on towards Portree
    	• First stop, coop. Stocked up on some grub and then headed towards Storr to find a campsite
    	• Finding a place to park and sleep is a lot harder when it’s dark out. And the fact that I usually get to that point in my day so much later than others doesn’t make it easy
    	• Back and forth, but found a spot anf hit the sack

    2021.09.12
    	• Another not so great night’s sleep, but up and at em to try and beat the tourist rush to Storr
    	• Packed and organized, then drove over. Toyed with just staying parked and hiking over to save the dough, but figured I can penny punch elsewhere, and the parking fee is a baseline contribution to support me being able to enjoy nature and such
    	• It was still rainy and cloudy at the top when I rolled up; so ended up making breakfast in the car to pass the time
    	• Also shaved in the bathroom, as I was way overdue for that
    	• Eventually, geared up and started the hike
    	• All uphill to get to the main attractions, but once there, and wonderful potpourri and free for all!!!
    	• Old Man of Storr, a collection of giant rock faces and some unique pillars/features, with trails zigzagginfnandnwinding through all of it
    	• Thankfully, as and by the time I was up there, the rain died down and it all became clear to see!!! Hot damn!!!
    	• Coire Faoin - incredible amphitheater below the highest point, just listening to the wind dance across the grass. Lovely sound and display
    	• Coire Scamadal - incredible amphitheater on the other side of the area. The smell and feel of the fresh air while sitting there wasninvigorating. Very tempted to up and down the hike all the way to Quiraing. But saw it was a 12miler and wasn’t prepped for that: really want to do that all next time though

    2021.09.13
    	• A
    	• Hiking Ben Alligin, had TI’s The Good Life stuck in my head. Damn it’s true for me. I bitch and complain about so much, but I’ve got a damn good life and I am blessed beyond belief

    2021.09.14
    	• Woke up, didn’t sleep bad but not great
    	• Fucking midges we’re out in full force, so I tried to do everything without getting out of the car. Had to get out to heat up water, hit thankfully survived
    	• Made my oatmeal and some coffee, and just stayed in my pjs as I hit the road
    	• First stop - SHOWER
    	• Finally, first in a week. Felt so damn nasty dirty and grimy
    	• Skimped one from thr torridon public toilets, stupidly forgot to donate money after showering and filling up my water, but what a lifesaver
    	• As I loaded up thr car, I walked over to the field across the lot to take pictures of the sign and mountains, just looked like a gorgeous framing
    	• Holy Batman, saw two elk, male and female, prancing across the field a ways off!!! Damnit, had the wrong lens on
    	• Luck would have it, instead of prancing away, they started coming closer!!! Got to about 100’ away, before the male went left and female followed, quite thr gathering of folks watching. But gorgeous!!! Really dark coats. Neature, love it
    	• Enjoyed that, then hit thr road
    	• What. A. Drive.
    	• Calm, low key, gorgeous mountain sights
    	• Was in a very low key and relaxed mood, just really enjoying thr drive and stopping often to take pictures and breathe it in
    	• Slowly got into Kinlochewe and initial plan was to turn right towards Inverness. But thr adventure bug talked sense into me and I turned left, time for an extended loop around. Love me some freedom in adventuring :-)
    	• Shortly thereafter got to a trail center right on the water. Got out and snagged a spot on the shore of a rock chair. Got comfy and enjoyed the time watching thr mountains and taking it all in. Peaceful, gorgeous. Reading the signs; the mountain across used to be 5km tall, now about 1km. I know it was ages ago, but that seems far fetched…
    	• After the Ben Alligin hike, I told myself today was going to be a low key (ie no hiking or biking) day, and despite the lure of thr trail from thr trail center, I held to that. Back on the road
    	• Shortly after leaving there, a wee bit of rain hit the world. In thr car, thankfully, so beautiful
    	• Got to Gairloch and pulled in. Thought about pottery, and how I’d seen some pottery stores on skye and throughout thr drive, and remembered my broken favorite mug :-( searched and saw a pottery studio in Ullapool, put that on the map for a target

    	• Mark the Brit at one of the viewpoints, random conversation started by asking how I got here from Germany and learned that he’s a former trucker waiting on trace to Brazil to be possible so he can get back to his farm down there. He was astounded at how quiet and calm and gorgeous Scotland/The Highlands are. And damn it’s truly amazing how you can find peace and quiet here like nowhere else…
    	• A
    	• Sitting having my beers in Newtonmore, two blokes sitting behind me. Probably you-mid 20s, military (I think navy, but we’re not near the water), talking about fighting and air friers. Proper funny to listen in

    2021.09.15
    	• Easy up and at em. Got Rupert rearranged then headed to thr trail center
    	• Epitome of a relaxing start. Got there, made my oatmeal and a coffee, and sat and read my book. What a delight :-)
    	• Up the hill to start, damn climbing rock gardens
    	• Couple guys chatting at the top, joined in for a bit
    	• Down, kinda. Too much uphill pedaling during the down part of thr trail
    	• Would be the theme of thr whole place. That and no berms on sharp corners
    	• The one part of thr trail that was really fun was the last few hundred feet of the red. An actual berm and flow.
    	• Plenty of good, fun, technical, rocky sections, but too many uphills in between
    	• Back to the car for lunch after EFI
    	• Chowed on some delicious Serbian Reis pot, again, relaxing
    	• Got approached by Sebastian the german living in Scotland. Needed tape and we had a chat. Between jobs so driving and biking around thr further from home trails. Likely see him at Conroe tomorrow
    	• Then in line for thr loo chatted with a motorcyclist with his crew journeying around Scotland for the week. Super friendly dude
    	• Then chatted with Steve the scot and got some more recommendations
    		○ Aberfeldy, especially top of the world
    		○ Golfie, on the other side of the river from Innerleithan
    		○ Torridon Loop
    		○ McMaster Rider, Scottish you river
    	• Went to hit the unsanctioned trails. Hell of a pedal up at the end, pushed most of the way
    	• At the top of the hill, some kind of old fort. Checked it out, didn’t seem like an old fort, just a giant rock outcropping. Beautiful spot though
    	• Sick, ready, jumped on my bike ready to ride, some kind of grinding sound
    	• Knew it was the mudguard, but couldn’t figure out how it got so misshapen
    	• Tried to bend it back, nothing working, STR
    	• Then I saw it. Fuck. Fuck me. Fuck my life. Broken seat stay. Commence all levels of sadness
    	• Walked my bike down the hill, down what would’ve been the best trail of the day. You’ve got to be kidding me….
    	• Back at the car, not sure what to do with myself and my life and my trip
    	• Next few days we’re all biking, that’s shot.
    	• Felt completely lost and adrift
    	• Slowly pieced things together, or tried to
    	• Booked a whiskey tasting for the morrow, and got changed to let my clothes air out
    	• Started doing some research on bike replacement, because now it’s an emergency. No chance at saving her this time without some kind of miracle :-(
    	• Then Sebastian from earlier rolled in. Showed him the sadness, then we went and grabbed a coffee
    		○ He’s been living in Scotland for a good five years now, between jobs
    		○ Agreed that living in a country with friendly people is such a nice thing
    		○ Harris Gin
    		○ Interesting to hear how the NHS, Uks health system, is financially controlled separately by region
    		○ Scotland similar to New Zealand in a good few ways - progressive, small, in a good spot
    		○ Interesting to hear more background on the independence referendum. Now that they’re already out of the eu, interesting to see the timeline and affect on the next referendum
    		○ Such a beautiful country
    		○ Told me about tweed love, big demo event in Perbles near Innerleithen this weekend - aka a chance at still riding with a demo bike!
    		○ Had a lovely chat with him
    	• Filled up water, then kinda bummed in my camp chair trying to figure out what to do. Felt so down and aimless and lost (dramatic but true)
    	• Eventually pulled off my bike pedals for Saturday, sent some emails, and spent a ton of time looking for where to go eat
    	• Ended up back at the place from last night
    		○ Beer was the highlight
    		○ Weird tomato soup and the chicken was dry
    		○ Got a lot of reading in, just getting juicy in the book
    	• Then off to sleep the day off
    	• Found a nice lay y near the previous night
    	• Went and sat by the water for a bit, but damn midges ruin everything

    2021.09.16

    2021.09.17

    	• Lovey evening with Derek and Susan. Such welcoming and generous hosts. Derek had some great beers to share, Susan cooked up a delicious fish pie, and Angus their English terrier was as friendly and chill as can be!



    <h2 id="Commentary">Let the Commentary Begin...</h2>

    <h3>Musical Realizations</h3>

    <p>This doesn't really have anything directly to do with memories, per-se, but while I was writing up this post and my post about going home, I somehow got onto Mac Miller and had his tunes (most of his new stuff) giving me some good vibes while I was writing things up.</p>

    <p>Well, during a mental break I looked him up and realized he's dead. Died in 2018 due to a drug overdose. Which, as I put 2 and 2 together, one of the albums I was listening to (Circles) was a posthumous release. That kinda shocked me a bit. Good music, and from someone who put out a ton and had enough stored up for a release after he was gone.</p>

    <p>Not sure where I'm going with this, but it was a bit of a weird realization.</p>
