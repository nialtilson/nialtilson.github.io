    <p>Well everyone, no other way to put this other than life has been rough for me over the past couple of years. It's clear to see it's been a good long while since I've done anything here, and because of that this is going to be a lightning fast summary of the last 2+ years, including putting up some things that I'd already written over previous adventures, and highlighting everything else that's happened.</p>

    <p>Why the sudden change of heart? Well, at this current moment in time I've got a little time on my hands, as I'm in the midst of a transition from Germany back to the US. It was not an easy choice or process, but everything's underway right now and at the time of typing these words right here, I've only got 38 hours til my flight leaves. Crazy, but I'll fill in what I can.</p>

    <p>Starting off with filling in, here's the dump of everything that just got left on the drafting table when my interest/motivation/drive/focus completely disappeared sometime in early 2023...</p>

    <h2 id="Recap1">Recap - Printing the Scraps</h2>

    <p>I discovered that I'd already had a few things started and completed from way back when. First off, were a couple posts that I forgot to upload.</p>

    <p>First up was a recap I had down in the Balkans hiking with the fantastic duo of Luke and Jelley! The <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20220814_PeaksoftheBalkans.html">Peaks of the Balkans</a> trek was an absolutely gorgeous time and down in Montenegro, Albania, and Kosovo, and showed us some incredible scenery, wonderful people, and a gorgeous area of Europe!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/KLIgGBch.jpg" alt="The Trek Gang"></img>

    <p>After that, I put together a summary of the rest of the end of 2022 in <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20221113_AWholeLotofCatchingUp.html">A Whole Lot of Catching Up</a>. Here some adventures all over the place wandering around Europe. Take a look, but be prepared, it's another one of my famous long ones...</p>

    <p>Then, the rest of the scraps that I found were just starts to trips that I had taken and know would've been some insanely long write-ups. First was the time I went <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20230412_MeanderingthroughMorocco.html">A Meandering through Morocco</a>. That was a very interesting trip through Morocco during Ramadan, and my first exposure to Africa! The Polarsteps link has a lot of pictures and some details on that adventure.</p>

    <p><em>Then at this point in the timeline was my last actually published post, <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20230527_ATumultuousLifeUpdate.html">A Tumultuous Life Update</a></em></p>

    <p>One of my most memorable, profound, and incredible trips while living over here was <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20230805_RoadTrippinthroughScandanavia.html">Road Trippin' through Scandanavia</a>. Five weeks, me and Rupert, visiting and seeing friends along the way, and roadtripping down the coast of Norway. Words can't describe how incredible that trip was and how beautiful that area of the world is. I would go back in a heartbeat and spend even more time there, just continually diving into the incredible nature that incredible country has to offer!!!</p>

    <p>Then, I had <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20230820_ABusyEndto2023.html">A Busy End to 2023</a>. I only got as far as typing up the beautiful drive down towards the Zugspitze, but there was a LOT more that was involved with that end of 2023.</p>

    <h2 id="Recap2">Recap - End of 2023 to Start of 2025</h2>

    <p>Buckle up folks and keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle, because this little trip is gonna be fast. I'm pretty much just gonna base this part on the photo albums I have on my computer for the past two years, so here are the highlights.</p>

    <p>In August 2023, I went down to the border of Germany and Austria, and summited the Zugspitze. That's the tallest point in Germany. Despite the illegality of wild camping in Central Europe, I took my tent and made a one-nighter out of it. Beautiful weather and a great hike up to the top, and an incredible ride on the insane cable car that goes all the way up to the peak.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/H44KdqKh.jpg" alt="Zugspitze Peak"></img>

    <p>September 2023 was full of fun. To start, I flew up to Stockholm for a weekend with my good buddy Eli Hollowell. That's an absolutely awesome city and I had the best seafood risotto of my life there. Then, that next week I drove down to Lyon to go watch New Zealand plan in the 2023 Rugby World Cup! Taking advantage of the drive south, after the game I went for a 3-night backpacking trips in the French Alps and had incredible scenery throughout.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ogHpQ8Hh.jpg" alt="Sunny Stockholm Harbor"></img>

    <p>In October 2023 I flew with a couple colleagues for a work trip to Istanbul. That was quite the experience culturally, to start in a work context, and then I extended my trip for a couple days to explore around the gateway between Asia and Europe. What an incredible city. Massive, tons to see, and a very unique vibe to it. That was a really enjoyable and beautiful trip.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/8VAJcWhh.jpg" alt="The Bridge between Continents"></img>

    <p>Finishing up 2023 I started my adventures into the world of 3D-Printing, made a workbench for my 3D Printer, got in a bunch of biking, but then it ended on a quick trip back to the US to help my Mom with some surgery she had. Glad you're doing well Mommy! :-) But this was also a part of time where I was pretty down in the dumps. Most of 2023 was quite difficult for me mentally and emotionally, and the end of 2023 is when it really all came to the max.</p>
