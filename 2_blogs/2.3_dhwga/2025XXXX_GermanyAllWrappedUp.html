    <p>Well everyone, there's no other way to put this other than life has been kinda rough and extremely dynamic for me over the past couple of years. It's clear to see it's been a good long while since I've done anything here, and because of that this is going to be a lightning fast summary of the last 2+ years, including putting up some things that I'd already written over previous adventures, and highlighting everything else that's happened.</p>

    <p>Why the sudden change of heart? Well, at this current moment in time I've got a little time on my hands, as I'm in the midst of a transition from Germany back to the US. It was not an easy choice or process, but everything's underway right now and at the time of typing these words right here, I've only got 38 hours til my flight leaves. Crazy, but I'll fill in what I can.</p>

    <p>Starting off with filling in, here's the dump of everything that just got left on the drafting table when my interest/motivation/drive/focus completely disappeared sometime in early 2023...</p>

    <h2 id="Recap1">Recap - Printing the Scraps</h2>

    <p>I discovered that I'd already had a few things started and completed from way back when. First off were a couple posts that I forgot to upload.</p>

    <p>First up was a recap I had down in the Balkans hiking with the fantastic duo of Luke and Jelley and their friend Greer! The <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20220814_PeaksoftheBalkans.html">Peaks of the Balkans</a> trek was an absolutely gorgeous time down in Montenegro, Albania, and Kosovo, and showed us some incredible scenery, wonderful people, and a gorgeous area of Europe!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ihAcEJ3h.jpg" alt="Three Trees"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VgpY4m6h.jpg" alt="Wizard Goat"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/KLIgGBch.jpg" alt="The Trek Gang"></img>

    <p>After that, I put together a summary of the rest of the end of 2022 in <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20221113_AWholeLotofCatchingUp.html">A Whole Lot of Catching Up</a>. Here are some adventures all over the place wandering around Europe. Take a look, but be prepared, it's another one of my famous long ones...</p>

    <p>Then, the rest of the scraps that I found were just starts to trips that I had taken and know would've been some insanely long write-ups. First was the time I went <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20230412_MeanderingthroughMorocco.html">A Meandering through Morocco</a>. That was a very interesting trip through Morocco during Ramadan, and my first exposure to Africa! The Polarsteps link has a lot of pictures and some details on that adventure.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZR4Refkh.jpg" alt="Dune Ridge Horizon"></img>

    <p><em>Then at this point in the timeline was my last actually published post, <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20230527_ATumultuousLifeUpdate.html">A Tumultuous Life Update</a></em></p>

    <p>One of my most memorable, profound, and incredible trips while living over (t)here (and in life in general, it was absolutely indescribable...) was <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20230805_RoadTrippinthroughScandanavia.html">Road Trippin' through Scandanavia</a>. What an insanely amazing and wonderful and beautiful and incredible this trip was. Five weeks, me and Rupert, visiting and seeing friends along the way, and roadtripping down the coast of Norway. Words can't describe how incredible that trip was and how beautiful that area of the world is. Seriously. I cannot relay this enough. I would go back in a heartbeat and spend even more time there, just continually diving into the incredible nature that incredible country has to offer!!!</p>

    <p>Then, I had <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20230820_ABusyEndto2023.html">A Busy End to 2023</a>. I only got as far as typing up the beautiful drive down towards the Zugspitze, but there was a LOT more that was involved with that end of 2023.</p>

    <h2 id="Recap2">Recap - End of 2023 to Start of 2025</h2>

    <p>Buckle up folks and keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle, because this little trip is gonna be fast. I'm pretty much just gonna base this part on the photo albums I have on my computer for the past two years, so here are the highlights.</p>

    <p>In August 2023, I went down to the border of Germany and Austria, and summited the Zugspitze. That's the tallest point in Germany. Despite the illegality of wild camping in Central Europe, I took my tent and made a one-nighter out of it. Beautiful weather and a great hike up to the top, and an incredible ride on the insane cable car that goes all the way up to the peak.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/H44KdqKh.jpg" alt="Zugspitze Peak"></img>

    <p>September 2023 was full of fun. To start, I flew up to Stockholm for a weekend with my good buddy Eli Hollowell. That's an absolutely awesome city and I had the best seafood risotto of my life there. Then, that next week I drove down to Lyon to go watch New Zealand play in the 2023 Rugby World Cup! Taking advantage of the drive south, after the game I went for a 3-night backpacking trips in the French Alps and had incredible scenery throughout.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/H1BCJs1h.jpg" alt="Alps Fall Colors"></img>

    <p>In October 2023 I flew with a couple colleagues for a work trip to Istanbul. That was quite the experience culturally, to start in a work context, and then I extended my trip for a couple days to explore around the gateway between Asia and Europe. What an incredible city. Massive, tons to see, and a very unique vibe to it. That was a really enjoyable and beautiful trip.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/PTm0vLSh.jpg" alt="National Turkish Mosque"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/8VAJcWhh.jpg" alt="The Bridge between Continents"></img>

    <p>Finishing up 2023 I started my adventures into the world of 3D-Printing, made a workbench for my 3D Printer, got in a bunch of biking, but then it ended on a quick trip back to the US to help my Mom after some surgery she had. Glad you're doing well Mommy! :-) But this was also a part of time where I was pretty down in the dumps. Most of 2023 was quite difficult for me mentally and emotionally, and towards the end of 2023 is when it really all came to the max.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/LBUgTiih.jpg" alt="Building the Backing"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BXGcRTVh.jpg" alt="3D Print Bench"></img>

    <p>Well, early on in 2023 is when my relationship with Theresa ended and honestly that, paired with my insane Analysis Paralysis regarding what I should do with my life sent me into a bit of a spiral. It involved some therapy, tons of deep discussions with friends, lots of anxiety, unsureness, self-consciousness, tons of new grey hairs and signs of aging, and in general signs and experiences of struggle trying to figure out what do with my life. Do I stay? Do I go? Where do I fit? What should I do with my life? What do I want to do? Am I cut out for anything? Have I wasted time these last few years?</p>

    <p>Those are big and heavy questions to ponder. Some of them were/are warranted, but also some aren't/weren't. That doesn't make it easier, as they were all passing thorugh my mind in the process of trying to decide what to do. Thankfully, I never stopped adventuring, having fun, and meandering around the world through the end of 2023 and all of 2024, but in this process of transition, I am realizing and seeing just how much my deep mood affected me in a consistent manner and going back through pictures over this time frame has made it extremely clear - the last two years really affected me and had me down. But as I said, I still kept my wheels rolling and had some fun in the process.</p>

    <p>Looking back, 2024 was really my victory lap and emphasis on the last five years that I'd spent in Germany. At some point the fact that my time in Europe was coming to an end hit pretty hard close to home, so I did all that I could to do everything I wanted to while I was still in Germany. And believe me, that included a lot of fun, exciting, adventurous, and memorable experiences, but there's still an incredibly long list waiting to be tackled that I couldn't get to.</p>

    <p>Towards the start of the year, I wrangled a bunch of my buddies together to get out and go see some of the local sports teams. There were a few on my bucket list, so I figured why not do it with some great friends! In total, we got out and saw KSC (soccer), the Mannheim Adler (hockey), Rhein-Necker Löwen (handball), Baden Volleys (volleyball), and maybe something else. I've always been a sports fan, so it was an excellent opportunity to (finally) got to some of the local sports games. Fun times.</p>

    <p>In Feb 2024 I was needing a little snow in my life, so I wandered on down to the Alps for a weekend of snowshoeing. It was fan-flipping-tastic, with incredible snow, and great weather throughout! I will say though, that trip has given me the itch to learn how to ski. I'm a big fan of snowshoeing, but seeing the skiers on skins going up and then being able to scream back down, made me wish I wasn't firmly connected to the snow. But hey, doesn't matter how you get out and enjoy it, just so long as you dive into nature! Also had my first actual car accident on the way back. Poor Rupert...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/OtG0Xsvh.jpg" alt="Poor Rupert..."></img>

    <p>Obviously I was mountain biking throughout and ripped it up with Stefan, Philipp, the Rombachs, and Puschners as much as I could. That holds true for the whole year, but in the interest of brevity, just covering that real quick here.</p>

    <p>In early March Luke and Jelley came for a visit!!! They were in Frankfurt getting ready to help put on the Euro 2024 tournament, so shortly after they moved to town they came down to Karlsruhe for the day! We grabbed breakfast and then walked around town most of the day, and it was an awesome chance to cross paths again with these intrepid world travelers!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cFPmGOzh.jpg" alt="Stroopwafel Pic"></img>

    <p>The end of March was capped off with an incredible weekend with some amazing friends. Andy Maxx had a birthday, but since he lived in Kassel, he invited everyone up to come spend the weekend! A few of us headed up early for some 'working from home' to start the shenanigans early, but what an incredibly fun weekend, and great birthday concept! A little disc golf, a hockey game, some family garden parties, and a grand old time.</p>

    <p>Over Easter I (finally) reconnected with my buddy Mike McLaffyTaffy and joined on one of his adventures. He's lived in Germany for the majority of the decade since our CBYX program, and a new goal he's set for himself is to climb all of the highest peaks in each EU country. He's started with a few, but to utilize some of the holidays, we put Easter on the map to head to Hungary and hit their highest point.</p>

    <p>A sweet weekend in yet another new country! We met up and centralized in Budapest, and what a beautiful city. Incredible architecture, really interesting history, and tons of food and beer to enjoy (with flavor!!!). We walked all around town throughout the weekend and there are tons of cools nooks and things to explore. One of the days we took the train and the bus a couple hours out of town to go hike up the 'peak' named Kekes and had a great walk to the top. Beautiful, kinda flat, countryside, and a great way to get a little neature in. Overall, awesome trip with a great person, and a great exposure to a unique country!</p>

    <p>Truth.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/xqIm2TAh.jpg" alt="Magical Unicorn"></img>

    <p>At the end of April, I got my first, but not last, exposure to the wonderful country of Ireland. Jeff Arcuri was in Europe for a few shows, so I found a spot I hadn't been to, booked tickets, and made a nice weekend out of it in Dublin. Yet again, what an incredibly cool town. I had some great weather to enjoy, and explored all around the city, and got in a beautiful hike along the coast before flying out. Jeff was funny, but damn that Guiness tasted great.</p>

    <p>A highlight of EVERY one of the past few years has always been in the best month of the year. I and all my Pen15ers pile into a van, drive overnight across France, and make it for the sunrise before a killer beach frisbee weekend. Seriously, and incredible highlight everytime this team comes together. Sadly, 2025 will be absent us at the tourney because we couldn't get enough people ready to play (kids, and responsibilites, sheesh...)</p>

    <p>The theme for 2024 was the Olympics, as Paris was hosting. So I whipped something together as part of our spirit packet to give medals to all the MVPs in our games. I was stoked, ready, and holy fuck what a fun time. Petanuqe, Kronenbourg, Durak, Beach Arcade, and shenanigans all around. Always a highlight with that crew. Always. AllePen Zero Points.</p>

    <p>Then, going from one crazy awesome thing to the next, in May I played with the Karlsruhe Mixed Masters Ultimate team in the German Championships (we got 3rd or 4th, not bad!), then gathered up three weeks of Vacation and Overtime and packed Rupert up with my camping and biking gear and B-Lined it back up to Scotland. Oh fucking yeah. And to summarize this trip in just a couple of paragraphs is an absolute blasphemous travesty (this one and my trip to Norway. I'm really bummed I didn't have the mental space to truly document those trips. Absolutely amazing, both). But thankfully there's a quasi-attempt at such through my Polarsteps trip - <a class="body" href="https://www.polarsteps.com/NialTilson/11561152-scotland-round-2-celtic-boogaloo">Scotland Round 2 - Celtic Boogaloo</a>.</p>

    <p>But seriously, absolutely incredible. The trip started with a lazy day rolling through the hilly regions of Luxembourg and Southeastern Belgium before making it with a ton of luck to the ferry across the Channel. Then a quick night in Dover before heading to the airport...</p>

    <p class="quickhit">On a hike along the Cliffs of Dover, I walked down to an old bunker perched in the cliffs and had the spot to myself for a while. Sitting on the stairs heading to the water I was greeted with the most unique, peculiar, and soothing sound of the waves as they flowed out back to the sea, crashing against the rocks on their retreat. Check it out.</p>

    <p>Nothing like a great shred visit from my buddies Andy and John!!! They flew over for a week of MTBing through Wales and Scotland, and holy shit did we rip!!! First we headed over to Wales for Dyfi Bike Park. It was wet as shit that day, but we got sloppy and had a killer time. Amazing bike park, and would definitely love to head back in good weather. Only one short day there, then we took a long slow drive up through Wales, into the Lake District, and then crossing into Scotland to head to the glorious Tweed Valley. Holy shit was the riding there incredible.</p>
