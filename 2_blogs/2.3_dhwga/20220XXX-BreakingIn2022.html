    <p>The holiday break with Zack cruising through Portugal as an absolute blast. Back to traveling, back on another adventure with my buddy, it was a total blast. The couple days I had at home after that before work started back up was also relaxing, fun, and nice to slowly gear back up. Unfortunately, since then, it's been a whirlwind of work and chaos. I thought things would've slowed down to start the year off, but that's been way too far from the truth.</p>

    <h2 id="Snow">Snowshowing in the Schwarzwald</h2>

    <p>Before heading back to work for the year, in the couple free days I had at home after the trip, I lined up to go snowshoeing with the gal from the date before the trip. Thankfully, there was a little snow up in the hills (there hasn't been much all this year unfortunately :-( ...), so we packed our things in the car, took the short drive down to a random spot in the Schwarzwald, and got to trekking!</p>

    <p>As this was a bit of a random planning spurt, there wasn't a ton of weight placed on the perfect route or anything like that. But as it turns out, this was the same spot/area that I went for a romp around some snow last year! The conditions were about the same, there was plenty of snow on the ground, and we ended up back-tracking a good bit of the route that I took the year before.</p>

    <p>We first started on a pretty empty trail, and it was quite beautiful. Fresh snow, no people, and just a beautiful walk in the white wonderland. We eventually made it to the tiny little ski hill tucked up in the forest, and romped our way up to the top for a break with a little camp stove action and coffee.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/8BG3d88h.jpg" alt="A White Path"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xaHXnyOh.jpg" alt="Sweet Snowshoe"></img>

    <p>After the break, it was time for some deep trudging. The route we wanted to take was closed off for nature protection, so we blazed our own path through the deep snow and fallen trees. It was adventurous. But after a while of trudging, we were back on the path, and slowly from there worked our way downhill and back out. A great way to enjoy some fresh air before returning to the stifling world of work.</p>

    <h2 id="Food">Adventures in Foodiness</h2>

    <p>Coming into this year, I've been working on getting more proactive when it comes to food. I'm a decent cook, and I enjoy the process as well as the result, but cooking for one can become a chore. Because of that, 90% of the time I chop up some veggies, add in some meat, pick out a sauce, and put it all together either with rice, noodles, potatoes, or lettuce. Basic as shit, but it usually comes out pretty good.</p>

    <h3>Killer Cookies</h3>

    <p>Basic, deadly, and oh so delicious. Found an old cooke recipe in our family's recipe stash, and threw a couple twists in. I made some similar ones last year, and kept that delicious train rolling. Chocolate chunks, dark chocolate M&Ms, chocolate mint granola chunks, and extra leftover from christmas - christmas sprinkles. Needless to say, they turned out great.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/sIPfatuh.jpg" alt="Cookie Madness"></img>

    <p>The reason I made them though was to share with my coworkers. I initially planned to make them as christmas cookies, but by the time I got to them in December all my coworkers were already out. So I made them to start the new year. Well, results were a bit mixed. I slightly overbaked them, so they were a little dry. And to be honest, I think the presence of variety in them might have annoyed their taste buds. Either way, I found them to be delicious, and that's what mattered to me.</p>

    <h3>Crispy Chorizo Gnocchi</h3>

    <p>Slightly cheated on this one, but with the pre-packaged gnocchi, some chorizo, and a few other things to it, holy shit deeeeeelicious. The inspiration for a lot of these came from reddit, and here's <a class="body" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/nbeuno/crispy_chorizo_gnocchi/">the recipe</a> for this one, definitely helps that it's in video form (which adds to the attraction for me).</p>

    <p>I gotta say, damn fine. Some of the comments laid into the recipe for a few too many tastes, but I was fat and sassy with it as is. That little caper/parsley sauce on it though? Hot dayum that was good! The best part was that the leftovers didn't taste like leftovers, but almost got better over time. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend this flavor bomb.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/omty95eh.jpg" alt="Crispy Chorizo Gnocci"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uS32YvAh.jpg" alt="Plated and Delicious"></img>

    <h3>Brussel Sprouts</h3>

    <p>Another dusted off recipe from a Family Christmas years back, it was time for some bacon and brussel sprouts, and also the incredible balsamic glaze that goes with it. Nothing too crazy, but I've never been good at sauces or have much experience with them. This glaze is easy, and absolutely delicious.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/afNLQzIh.jpg" alt="Brussel Sprouts"></img>

    <p>Here's <a class="body" href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a49497/bacon-balsamic-brussels-sprouts-recipe/">this recipe</a>, and again, I highly recommend it!</p>

    <h3>Spinach and Artichoke Mac & Cheese</h3>

    <p>I'd never made homemade Mac & Cheese before in my life. The blue boxes from Kraft aren't the healthiest, but I find them absolutely delicious, and therefore never branched out. Well, Europe lacks those blue boxes, and it was time to venture into this cheesy world. The perfect occasion came too, having Mischa and Christoph over for dinner!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ecj1NRBh.jpg" alt="Homemade Mac"></img>

    <p>Turned out to be delicious. Kinda mixed and matched from a few recipes, but <a class="body" href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a26593313/spinach-artichoke-mac-and-cheese-recipe/">here's the base one</a> I went off of. Shittons of cheese, not quite the stringiness one expects from mac and cheese, but it was yummy.</p>

    <h3>Bruschetta Refresha</h3>

    <p>Not sure why, but one weekend I had a hankering for some mozzarella. Leftover from the gnocchi I had a little basil plant sitting in my window, and new I just needed some tomatoes and I was ready to go. So after cutting it all up, maybe winging it more than an Italian would, I had some honestly pretty damn good bruschetta up and running.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/GRmbgc6h.jpg" alt="Bruschetta"></img>

    <p>Also was on a wine kick, so that always helps :-)</p>

    <h3>Kitchen Sink Frittata</h3>

    <p>Before heading out for a spontaneous week away, I had a bunch of stuff left in the fridge and was hungry. With a ton of extra eggs being part of that group, my mind turned to a frittata! Turns out these are pretty easy to do, but mine turned out kinda ok.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XBy3dvLh.jpg" alt="First Try Frittata"></img>

    <p>In following the recipe, I got all the ingredients cooked up and ready, and then just poured over the eggs before baking. Next time I'm gonna make sure I mix the eggs and ingredients together so it's not just a layer of egg on the top. Still turned out ok, but something to make it better next time.</p>

    <h2 id="GirlProblems">Girl Problems</h2>

    <p>I don't think it's a secret, but I'm pretty single. It's a bit of a sensitive and personal topic for me, but that's where it is. As I said earlier, I went on a couple dates with a gal, and they started off pretty fine. Long story short, after sharing that I eventually want a long-term thing with a family and all that, that apparently was too much for her to handle.</p>

    <p>I had some late night chats with a number of friends to try and help me get my mind around the situation (first the excitement of connecting with someone interesting and compatible, then the frustration/confusion as to why it went south so quickly), and there are a couple things that have come out of that experience. For one, I know what I want, and it's not necessarily a bad thing to share that. Timing, however, is important. I likely was too excited and jumped the gun on a few discussions, but I'm an excitable (and impatient) person. Both need to be tempered to a good degree in certain situations.</p>

    <p>Next, I may know what I want, which is really good for me and all. But other people are on different paths. Unfortunately, with this gal, she doesn't know where she's going. To be honest, glad that red flag came up quick. Nonetheless, bummer to know yet again I'm back at Square 0.</p>

    <p>Short and cryptic, but all that to say, nothing's working out on this front, and I'm trying to come to grips with that. And in the mean time, focus on me, work on who I am, and get my head on straight so I can be sure to love myself before trying to love someone else.</p>

    <h2 id="BikeHD">Back on the Bike - Heidelberg</h2>

    <p>I can never go too long without a little two-wheeled fury, so it was high time for me to be back on my steed and heading downhill. It's still winter over here, but thankfully that doesn't mean that all the trails are closed down, so I headed up to Heidelberg for a day in the woods.</p>

    <p>It was a cold, chilly, misty-sunny day there, and damn it was a lot of fun. The ground was pretty much frozen, and grip was fantastic. Somehow I re-discovered both a really technical trail (yes!!!) and a trail with a couple drops (yes!!!), and it was an absolutely fantastic ride!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cIxzcLnh.jpg" alt="Sunny Snowy Morning"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/H4rVZWth.jpg" alt="Bike Ready"></img>

    <p>In the interest of being social and not being a total hermit, I reached out to my buddy Franz, who moved up to Heidelberg last year. He wasn't able to join on the ride, but after I was done I motored on over to their place and got to meet up with them! After talking with him and his wife Steph (and their new baby Anton!), it'd been over a year and a half since we'd last seen each other. Bummer of a realization, but thankfully it was just like yesterday in seeing them again. Great folks, great friends, and I'm super glad I got to see them after the ride.</p>

    <p>Well that rekindling of contact led to further rekindling and riding, as I got back in contact with Stefan here in Karlsruhe, who's also great friends with Franz! A few weeks later, we were able to meet up, all four of us (Franz's parents were in town and were able to watch over Anton), and head out on a ride! It was another cold day, and this time a little slipperier and wetter than before, but another great ride together.</p>

    <p>Having riding buddies is such a nice bonus. I'd be riding either way, but it's so much fun to have folks to shred, laugh, and ride with! Adding to that sentiment, more to come later :-)</p>

    <h2 id="Bierkistendecken">Bierkistendecken - Project Complete</h2>

    <p>Going all the way back to last summer, I had a conversation with Christoph about a little project he wanted to do. Beer cases here are all a standard size - hard plastic, 20 bottles at 0.5L, and stackable. Well he somehow got the idea to make a topper for them, so you can use the cases as tables/chairs/nightstands/whatever.</p>

    <p>That conversation was all the way back in Summer 2021. And with my slow-ass progress, it took me all the way until Winter 2022 to get them done! But after coming back from Portugal, finally getting over the mental hump and hindrance of staining, I made some progress. After a total of three coats on each one, they were done!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZZYsLNqh.jpg" alt="Singular Topper"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/kColOmnh.jpg" alt="Toppers in a Row - Front"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CTpdmzyh.jpg" alt="Toppers in a Row - Side"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/O3AS8Xhh.jpg" alt="Toppers in Use"></img>

    <p>In total, I made seven of them. One broke while building, so the six that came out in the end turned out pretty good. Some were made with some scrap wood, some from a new board I cut down to size. Two were for Christoph (since it was his idea), two were for me, one for Mischa, and one for a gift that I had to put together (more to come later).</p>

    <p>I love me a good woodworking project. Unfortunately, I'm really slow at them, and the processes of sanding and staining are such annoying mental hurdles for me. But nevertheless, nothing like having a beautiful tangible product at the end!</p>

    <h2 id="Organization">Getting Organized</h2>

    <p>One thing that really wore me out last year was just having so much to do, so much I wanted to get done, and not nearly a semblance of enough time to get it all done. It caused a lot of stress, frustration, and was just mentally draining to have all the things I wanted to get done in my mind (and a lot that I forgot about to boot...), and just not being able to fit them in. All because I was either working too much, focusing on something big, or just lacked the energy or motivation to get started on something even when I had the time to do so.</p>

    <p>Back when I was part of the autonomous project, we tried to implement a bunch of agile methodologies into our work, and one that I really liked was our <a class="body" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards">kanban board</a>. I had my own color, all my tasks were clearly laid out on the board, and I was able to physically move them around depending on what I was working on and what I'd completed.</p>

    <p>Around that time back in Portland, I even went so far as to implement that at home. I had that weird, unusable fireplace thing right in the middle of the living room, and that empty space turned into my kanban board. I had a few different categories of tasks I had in front of me, tracked the priority, and had a done pile for whenever I completed something.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/hwAqWngh.jpg" alt="My kanban board - Context"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iGgNTSRh.jpg" alt="My kanban board"></img><br>

    <p>Well right now, I'm not going in depth on anything or categorizing anything at all, I'm just working on the first step of getting the things I have to do laid out in front of me so I can track them. It's a single color, a jumbled mess of things to do, but I'm just working on making sure I keep track of all the things I have to do, and give myself the minimal reward of moving the post-it to the done pile once it's complete. It's also on my coat jacket closet, so every time I leave the house or come back, it's right in my face.</p>

    <p>Progress. Small progress, but progress nonetheless!</p>

    <h2 id="Photography">Photography Stuff</h2>

    <p>Coming out of the trip to Portugal, and having looked back at all the pictures I took, I was a bit disappointed in the overall quality of them. Yes, there were some good ones, but a lot of pictures that I was really excited about, liked, or were hoping for good results, came out blurry or just not ideal. Being a visual person, that really bummed me out.</p>

    <p>That said, my camera is 9 years old. The last time I took it in for service, the technician guy said at that point a few years ago, that it was an old bird anyways. So, knowing the camera body was likely on its last legs anyways, I splurged and got myself a new camera! My old Canon Rebel T4i is still alive (for now), but now I'm rolling around with a Canon 90D. There's a lot different about it compared to the old T4i, but those'll all just take some time to get used to.</p>

    <p>As soon as I got it, I sat around and played with the controls and settings to try and familiarize myself with it. My living room was my first test subject, and I got in a couple shots just to see how I can dial myself in with the thing.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/aRsEiKgh.jpg" alt="My Feet"></img><br>

    <h3>Night Photography</h3>

    <p>As a first little excursion with the new rig, I decided to take a cold, random Friday, jump on my bike, and head out with my tripod to get in some night photography practice. As I said, it was cold, and at the first stop I realized I forgot the tripod-camera mount (stupid), but I got to work on trying to capture some night scenes.</p>

    <p>It'd been a REALLY long while since I'd used my tripod or tried to do anything like this, and it turns out it's not as easy as I laid it all out in my head. I somehow would always come out with blurry pictures, and I think there were a couple culprits to that. For one, my tripod is light, but can be a tad unstable. Then again, any movement, wind or otherwise, is enough to make a blurry picture when the exposure goes for over half a second.</p>

    <p>Another likely reason, is that I was choosing some difficult scenes. In order to use autofocus, you need high contrast for the focus points to be able to get the right detail on the focus. For a couple of spots I wanted to shoot, there was very little contrast - aka everything was a similar shade of dark - and therefore autofocus had a tough time finding a spot to focus onto.</p>

    <p>All that said, I've still got a lot of room for improvement. Despite the cold night, I had some tunes in my ears and did a little riding around town to a few different spots, and came up with a few ok shots. Take a look!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SsSbzjEh.jpg" alt="KVV Haltestelle"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7ocwwGOh.jpg" alt="Tracks and Roadway"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yCwFLWhh.jpg" alt="The Lonely Trike"></img>

    <p>Not quite as good as my night shots from way back when in Hamburg, but something to keep cranking away at for sure. Looking forward to some warmer weather to make it a little easier to wander around at night!</p>

    <h3>Working on the Craft</h3>

    <p>Not sure how, but I've kinda gotten onto a mini reading kick, which I hope is slowly turning into a habit, since the start of the year. It's waned a bit in recent weeks, but after finishing off the book from José Saramago, I went to my bookshelf to see what I could dive into next. Rather than going the fiction route, I saw a couple photography books that I'd gotten but never read, and popped them out.</p>

    <p>First up is <em>Photography for the Joy of It</em>, and has been a great baseline look into the art of photography. Some concepts are new, some not, but getting a clarification on a lot of things, as well as some depth to the details behind them, has been a nice course.</p>

    <p>I've tried to internalize what I can from the book, and plan on using them next time I'm out traveling or shooting more photos. Here's to some improvement!</p>

    <h2 id="Swing">Getting Back to Swing</h2>

    <p>This whole pandemic bullshit has really had a negative impact on all of our lives, and one aspect for me that has been grinding me has been swing dancing. I haven't danced since I left Portland, which is now over two years ago. That's a crazy long time to not do something that I found so much enjoyment and fun in.</p>

    <p>To try and remedy this (and it's on my kanban board so I can't forget about it), I reached out to the local dance school to see what my options were. Long story short, I need a dance partner before I can dance. Not an easy prospect being still a foreigner and quasi-newbie in this town, but that's the deal.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, the dance school has a little portal to try and connect people looking for dance partners, so on the hunt! Luckily enough, I got in contact with one gal who seemed to be at a similar level. Needless to say, I was pretty excited. After a little back and forth and some contact, I confirmed it on my end that we'd start the coming Sunday, and assumed we were all good to go.</p>

    <p>Well, showing up to the dance school on that Sunday, I got my shoes on, and waited, but no one came. Since a parter is required to dance, I was left high and dry. I waited around a little while, but she never showed. Quite the bummer if you ask me.</p>

    <p>So, despite the impression that I was good to go and dance-ready, starting back (yet again) at Square 0. A common theme in a few aspects of life, but the search continues!</p>

    <h2 id="Sinsheim">The Technik Museum - Sinsheim</h2>

    <p>In the bridge between January and February, we were lucky enough to be able to host one of our testing colleagues from Portland during the integration workshop! Well, as I'd taken a trip out to the Technik Museum in Speyer in September, I didn't want Jon (our colleague) sitting around all weekend, so we planned to head up to the Technik Museum in Sinsheim! It was a short drive up, but we motored over and got to exploring the twin to the one in Speyer.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FhguqFqh.jpg" alt="Concorde and Russian Copy"></img>

    <p>As you'd imagine, it was just as cool and just as crammed with all kinds of stuff to please our engineering eyes and minds. Quite the conglomeration of cars, planes, trains, boats, tanks, and you can guess the rest. We did a lot of walking around, admiring the many unique and incredible pieces of machinery on site.</p>

    <p>Here were some of the highlights and thoughts we had during our romp around the museum:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I have no idea where they collected all these pieces, but there's a shitton of stuff there</li>
      <li>They have one of Lamborghini's old tractors!</li><br>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cCnXOCVh.jpg" alt="Lamborghini Tractor"></img><br>
      <li>They had a ton of tanks on site, but all of them were De-Militarized. What does that mean? Essentially a giant chuck of the armor had to be cut out to designate it as a no-longer functional tank. Pretty cool method.</li><br>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/jgvxu3eh.jpg" alt="Tank Row"></img><br>
      <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q0CBb7oh.jpg" alt="Demilitarisierung"></img><br>
      <li>Jesus Fucking Christ. Who the hell thought it ok to allow fucking swastikas in the museum. There weren't many, but goddamnit..... Get that sign of hatred out of there...</li>
      <li>Communism stands for Copying. I had no idea, but the USSR had created essentially a copy of the Concorde, and the museum had one on display. Cool plane, but seriously, nearly carbon copy...</li><br>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iJ44Tqah.jpg" alt="Concorde and Copy-SSR"></img><br>
      <li>On the tail of the Communist-Concorde-Copy, there were some asymmetric air flow guides, two lower on the left side, two higher on the right side. I've been meaning to look up the point of those, but that seemed a little curious to me as to why the asymmetry. Something to look into...</li><br>

    <p>Another incredible collection of incredible machines. It was a great time walking around, exploring, and chatting with Jon, and great to check out this jam-packed museum!</p>

    <h2 id="SuperBowl">Super Bowl Sunday</h2>

    <p>Anyone who knows me know's I'm a pretty big football fan. The immediately-recognizable Packers beanie is one sign, but Football has been in my blood since forever, and that ain't going away any time soon. Well, my Packers shat the bed in the playoffs, but thankfully the Niners choked too, so it was a Rams-Bengals Super Bowl where I didn't really care who won.</p>

    <p>Going back two years, I was invited to join the fantasy football league of a bunch of dudes I played frisbee with in 2016 and was ecstatic to join! Well in 2020, right before the pandemic came crashing down, we had a Super Bowl party to celebrate! Last year wasn't possible due to Covid, but with things in the slightly uphill trend of getting out of this health catastrophe, it was time to party!</p>

    <p>My team sucked all year. I had decent players, but every week, only one guy decided to play well and the others shat the bed. That took me to the shit bowl (losers playoff), and I somehow squeaked out a win in the semifinals and therefore didn't have to worry about hosting the Super Bowl party! That honer went to Glö, who got pretty unlucky with his team as well.</p>

    <p>But since the Super Bowl starts at midnight here, that means we had a whole day of drinking to help us get prepped for the football fun. Just like two years ago, on the agenda was a little Bosseling. Think of it as rolling a ball down a path from a start point to an end point, and whichever team does it in the fewest throws, wins! Simple and fun enough, we headed out to a forest to get things going.</p>

    <p>All with beers in hands (I love the fact you can drink anywhere in Europe...), we got things rolling! It was a beautiful, sunshiny day, and the company was just as wonderful, and we got to rolling and walking along with some great conversation and good times.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uOKa8S8h.jpg" alt="The Forest"></img>

    <p>After a good few hours, some good and bad throws, and a good few beers, we made a big 'ole loop around the forest and my team won. Woot!!! From there, it was back on the bikes and back to the 'frisbee' garden in the south of the city. There it was a good time to chill, hang out, chat, and for a big crew, to jump in the sauna. Also, look at Tim being a baus with a Weizen Glass on the bike. Love it.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eJjeISBh.jpg" alt="Glass and Bike"></img>

    <p>I hung out for a bit before heading home, heading to the failed swing dance class, and from there it was off to Glö's house for the full night. There, it was time for the full program. Wraps, Snack Stadium, Winners (aka Guzzer), and a good time all around. Guzzer is our commisioner, so it's a little sketchy that he won all the awards, but he had a good team, so I guess it was well earned.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Pv9lhduh.jpg" alt="Snack Stadium"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/j047MDah.jpg" alt="Guzzer Prize Machine"></img>

    <p>With a little Nintendo to get us through the 10pm, 11pm slog, we made it to kickoff around midnight and got to watching the game. In all, kind of a lame game, not just because of the teams, but honestly not all that exciting a game. Also, for some reason Foxi won almost all of the Squares money, seemed somehow rigged.</p>

    <p>After the game, it was quick back home for me, because I had a supplier visit at 9am the next day. Not ideal coming off of 5 hours of sleep, but that's what happens when the Super Bowl happens!</p>

    <h2 id="GoodDay">A Good Day</h2>

    <p>Not sure why or how, but Tuesday, February 15th was a great day for me. I had a great song stuck in my head, work was fine, it was sunny outside, and things were just feeling up. I really don't know where to put my finger down on it, but I really enjoyed the positive wave I was riding all day. I should force a few more of those into my schedule.</p>

    <h2 id="Music">Recent Tunes for your Groove Boxes</h2>

    <p>One contributor to the good mood I had on Feb 15th was a great song stuck in my head. The beat, vibe, mood, and random exclamation of "HORNS!" had me bobbing and weaving to the great tunes all day. In the interest of good music and sharing that kind of love, here are some tunes that have been weaving through my ear canals of late that you may or may not also find a good groove in.</p>

    <p><strong>Broke - Samm Henshaw</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe0Enf31npc">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1JqcZQCnxjDOfZZwQidb1H?si=640e0891b7bb4344">Spotify</a><br>
    Seriously, the "HORNS!" yell after the first bar makes me smile every time. But I love the horns, the groove, and the smooth vocals on this track. Bummer it's not over a bit more of a rosy topic, but love the good waves coming out from Samm Henshaw here.</p>

    <p><strong>Irrational - Shay Lia</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tVq-8jwj90">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/09m6It4feoA7uVhZxWUcbt?si=25349b13544847ce">Spotify</a><br>
    I've got a thing for good female vocals, and a little whispery tinge to it always helps. Another good Spotify recommendation with a good up-tempo beat and some lovely horns to round it all out.</p>

    <p><strong>Kaleidoscope Eyese (Audiotree Live Version) - Liz Cooper and The Stampede</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEV6oLN6gkA">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6ZqYeKK1HrmzmbNc4ywGQq?si=2e2e2292b26e4676">Spotify</a><br>
    Wonderful vocals? Check. Low key mood? Check. Live recording? Check. Great story and flow? Check. Such a relaxing and lovely listen.</p>

    <p><strong>House Call - The Shouting Matches</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM2aI35hLIA">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0rl5DA937m7eHFCMt2Wdxe?si=a2ae9c3fb1b74d63">Spotify</a><br>
    Good driving beats with a bunch of variety on the vocals, and something that goes well with a whispy glass of whiskey. Also a big fan of vocals that show a ton of emotion, and this one rides the emotional rollercoaster for a good bit of it.</p>

    <p><strong>Illusion - Beat Connection</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBKz5Wle_o">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/580frkT77JeeXvxAkKLrO0?si=8c6b48e463da4953">Spotify</a><br>
    Found out about Beat Connection through Spotify, but initially through one of their other songs (Hesitation, another great poppy, beat-full jam). Love the good beat, the drive, and the little story in this tune.</p>

    <h2 id="Madonna">New Bike <strike>Day</strike> Month!!!</h2>

    <p>The topic of a new bike has been pretty consistently on my mind way back since my frame broke broke in Scotland. That was a really depressing moment, and although I found myself a quick fix and way to keep riding for the months afterwards, I was really in the market for a new ride.</p>

    <p>The first option was to go through with the crash replacement setup (which is ongoing). Unfortunately, I had to send my broken frame into Transition in order to get that option going. But, on the upside, that means I've got a 30% off offer to a new bike (full build). Pretty slick deal when you add it all up. Although Transition said sometime Q1/Q2 of 2022, I haven't heard a lick of news from them since September/October timeframe. So that waiting game is still ongoing.</p>

    <p>In the mean time, thoughts of a new bike are still rolling around on my mind. And talking bike stuff doesn't really slow down, especially when you hang out and ride with the technical bike-crazy minds of Stefan and Franz. Both of them ride something from a pretty small German bike company, RAAW, and are essentially unpaid ambassadors for them. Franz got one of the first four Madonna V1s ever made by the company, and absolutely raves over it. Stefan has a Madonna V2, rides it like a machine, and it always comes back for more. He even won the first Madonna-of-the-Month awards. Popular dude.</p>

    <p>Way back when, sometime in September, I spur of the moment signed up for the Madonna info of when they'd be back in stock. I almost pulled the trigger and got one back then, but wasn't convinced on jumping from 27.5" wheels all the way up to a full 29" wheel rig. The new Patrol (which I've technically got on order) is a mullet, with 29" wheel front and 27.5" wheel back, so I'm already slated to jump into foreign waters with that.</p>

    <p>Well, sometime around mid-/end-January, I got a message from RAAW saying the Madonnas would soon be back on sale. That coincided with a few times riding with Franz and Stefan, and even getting to ride theirs for a quick taste. Long story short, when the bikes when back on sale at 15:00 on January 27th, I clicked away and snagged my new frame as fast as I could!</p>

    <p>RAAW only sells frames, which I can't blame them with all the delivery delays and such. But what that means, this new bike is going to be built from the ground up, fully customized, and ready to shred. I'll be publishing a new page with all that information and details on my new ride once it's here, built, and ready to go, but HOT FUCKING DAMN I'm totally stoked!!!!!</p>

    <p>It's been a whirlwind of decisions, parts ordering, stocking up, and getting ready to build. I've nearly got everything in place, but the frame is going to be the last thing to arrive. I'm hoping it arrives before I fly out to the US, but it's all a bit of a cat-and-mouse game with delivieries and such. Either way, I'm SO FREAKIN' STOKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <p>More to come on this later :-)</p>

    <h2 id="Finale">Freeridin' Finale</h2>

    <p>After that great day of riding with Stefan, Franz and Steph in Heidelberg, me and Stefan hit the road home and got to chatting. Turns out, as a teacher in Germany, you are employed by the state (both Franz and Stefan compare it to being a soldier), but that also means you get a ton of breaks. A ton. Germany has a bunch of holidays to begin with, but when you throw in school breaks and such, it adds up quick.</p>

    <p>One of those many school breaks was coming up - Winter Break or something, essentially a week off at the end of February/beginning of March. His plan - head down to Finale Ligure in Italy and mountain bike for a full week. As soon as I heard it, I got jealous. Finale Ligure is supposed to be an incredible mountain bike destination, and the chance to enjoy it for a full week sounded incredible!</p>

    <p>He threw out the great idea/offer of me coming down for some/all of it, and I immediately started thinking how I could make that work. I've got a bunch of vacation and over hours to blow off, so I figured I could make a long weekend out of it. Only an 8 hour drive, so why not?</p>

    <p>I reached out to the place Stefan was staying, and they had a 6 night minimum (likely because of the holiday, bummer). I looked around, and a lot of other places were booked out or not quite compatible with the dates I was thinking. Eventually I came to the point and just said fuck it. Why don't I take a full week off? And that's exactly what I did! One Fine Friday I put in a few hours of work and mid-afternoon, Rupert was all packed up and ready to head south. Italian Coast, here we come!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/48GaMGwh.jpg" alt="Rupert, packed and ready "></img>

    <p class="quickhit">That's become a pretty frequent pic of mine lately, and I kinda like it!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vYVFYpUh.jpg" alt="Horns Up on the Road Down"></img>

    <p>Getting down through Germany and parts of Switzerland were quite the breeze. Then traffic hit. First at the 16km long Gotthard tunnel. Not sure why they had stop lights active for a perfectly clear roadway, but that added a ton of time. Then, at the Italian border, entry into Como, was another parking lot. I wasn't feeling sitting in traffic, so found my way around it, and kept motoring on. Eventually, around 23:30, I made it to the hotel, got checked in, and was ready for a week of biking! Woot woot!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/mMQWv9Qh.jpg" alt="Rupert, Safe and Parked"></img>

    <p>That next morning, I was up early, and in a place I hadn't seen by daylight yet. Since we weren't heading to the bike shuttle til 10:30, I was off for a little morning walk in search of breakfast and getting a view of the little town on the coast. It was a fresh morning, but full of sunlight, and the little jaunt around town was beautiful. From the hotel I walked through the little pedestrian zone, made my way out to the water, then enjoyed the warm sunlight for a bit. Then on the way back, I stopped off at a little cafe for a croissant and Americano (they give you the espresso and hot water separately, so you can pour it yourself. Kinda neat!), before heading back to suit up for the daily ride.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iK5IQk6h.jpg" alt="Ligure Ped Zone"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/p3rl4rXh.jpg" alt="Ligure Bay West"></img>

    <p>Once 10:00 rolled around, it was time to roll! Stefan and I met at the bike locker, and we took the quick ride over to Finalborgo to get to the bike shuttle. A little bit of moseying around, and then we got packed into vans and headed up to NATO Base, one of the trailheads at the top of the hills above the coast. It was a good 40min ride from the coast up to the peaks, and with the clear skies and beautiful day ahead of us, once we biked up to the base, you could see for miles. If you squint, you can even see the island of Sicily there in the third pic below!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/oRwD7ZEh.jpg" alt="Stefan, on the way"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/DNnlIZ8h.jpg" alt="Top of NATO Base"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/E63DwR7h.jpg" alt="Sicily in the Distance"></img>

    <p>From the top, we did our (my) first run down Madre Natura, and I was immediately in heaven. Different than what I anticipated or thought I'd be riding, but hot fucking damn, so good. Flowy, loamy, rooty, a bit rocky, and just so damn buttery. We ripped right on down and with a big smile on my face, we turned around and pedaled back up to the top. From there, it was a round of Crestino Pt. 1, Carvarezza, Ingegnere, and Crestino Pt. 2. We even built a little rock bridge through a gully (that someone tore down the next day). Massive grins and energized blood flowing strong after such great trails, we rolled our way down the long road back to Finalborgo.</p>

    <p>Time for lunch, and getting ready for the next shuttle up. Stefan had a pizza place in mind, so we walked our bikes through the small old-town of Finalborgo, and were presented with a line out of Pomo D'Oro, the target shop. Nothing to do but wait until we were called in. And when we were, ohhhh boy what a selection. Definitely not your typical kinda pizza (not sure if it was Focaccia, Pizza, or some other classification), but I loaded up with the spicy sausage (wasn't spicy) and tomato and mozzarella 'slices' and we wandered out to eat them in the sun.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/sFvBep9h.jpg" alt="Pomo D'Oro"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ubdPUbgh.jpg" alt="Pizza Run"></img>

    <p>As we were walking with our bikes and pizza to the nearest bench, Stefan spotted a fellow Karlsruher! Mike was down for the week as well, and as I learned, he's essentially Finale local, coming down 5-7 times a year! We chatted with him once we sat and ate, but soon enough had to wrap up, pack up our last pieces of pizza for trail snacks, and book it back to the shuttle for the next ride up.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/LL9Llfah.jpg" alt="Loading Up"></img>

    <p>After the ride up, this time to the start of Rollercoaster, Stefan and I unloaded and were greeted by another Karlsruhe, Philip, and his buddy Eric! Turns out it was the week for half of Karlsruhe (or in all actuality, Germany) to head down to Finale! We chatted a bit at the top, met each other and got acquanted, then headed out down the trail as a new squad.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Pju1gMoh.jpg" alt="View at the Top of Rollercoaster"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/LepEW9Qh.jpg" alt="Patrol at the Ready"></img>

    <p>What an incredible trail. No massive berms like Whistler, no steep rocky chutes like I'd imagined, but incredlbe natural flow in some great dirt down a great hillside. Just good old fashioned fun mountain biking. We rolled and shredded our way down and I was smiling the whole way. Eventually we got to a great clearing and took in the view as two gibroni's were trying to be insta-famous and annoying as hell. But what an incredible view over Finale Ligure.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/g2shBXQh.jpg" alt="View over Finale"></img>

    <p>Once we blasted through the incredibly aptly named Rollercoaster, we popped out on the road and went on a bit of an adventure, courtesy of the experienced Finale-rider Mike. We found an offshoot and pedaled up, then jumped down the tucked-away Metanodotto. Another fun ride. That popped us out into a secluded valley, and we all pedaled down towards Borgo on the coast. As the day was nearly over, we took the laid-back option and found a cafe overlooking the water. Time to sit back and relax :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bXzsCKlh.jpg" alt="Patrol on the Water"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/HXV3XwNh.jpg" alt="Down the Coast"></img>

    <p>It was a beautiful day out, and although I was staring straight into the sun, the warmth was incredible, sky was blue, and the coffee hit just the right spot. We had a nice time sitting around, chatting, enjoying the day, and reveling on the great trails, all the way up to golden hour. About that time, it got a little cooler, so we paid up and pedaled on back to Finale. Eric and Philip were on a campsite up the hill, so Stefan and I said adios, pedaled on back to our hotel, and took some time to clean up and lay back after a great day of riding.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vFjw2Xkh.jpg" alt="Patrol in Golden Light"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SpPHMFxh.jpg" alt="Sundown Pedal Back"></img>

    <p>Dinner was a bit of a crapshoot, as we didn't have reservations anywhere, things were pretty full (Saturday night), and it was still technically the off-season. We struck out everywhere we popped our heads into, and ended up getting some takeaway pizza from a local joint and headed back to my room to chow down, chat, and revel in the wonderful week off. Pizza with a cheap 2€ bottle of Italian wine, not a bad way to end the night! Then, after we killed our grub, it was time for bed and another great day of riding to get some sleep for!</p>

    <p>The next two days followed a similar recipe - great riding, great food, great people. Seriously, that's such a great recipe for a great day! Sunday we did a single-uplift up to Nato Base and then took the Ingegnere series down to Orco Feglino, where they've got a series of trails that feed down to a similar spot and a pretty 'easy' climb straight back to the top. We got in a lap or two before settling down for a MASSIVE pan of pesto pasta out in the sunlight. We lapped it, the caffeine, and the sunlight up with a nice, long midday break. Hard to be some awesomeness like that.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CQtJS77h.jpg" alt="Stefan riding the correct bike"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Xh4bqjPh.jpg" alt="The Way Around"></img>

    <p>That night, luckily the shaky attempt at getting a reservation for dinner worked out! Stefan and I headed over to Da Ponci and one of the five tables open and waiting for us. This was my first time in one of these typical tiny Italian restaurants, and I was looking forward to it. Needless to say, it was absolutely aaaaaaaamazing. We split some really creamy foccacia, and then came the best meal of the trip, as the Primi (first course). Shrimp gnocchi with a pistachio cream sauce. Holy guano that was absolutely amazing!!! The gnocchi were soft and tender, the shrimp flavorful, and that sauce was absolutley impeccable. My second course was a sea bream filet with roasted artichokes over a zucchini paste. Holy god the food in Italy is incredible.</p>

    <p>Then Monday, thanks to a little stroke of luck with timing and someone cancelling last minute, Stefan and I got the last two spots on a guided shuttle day on Monte Carmo! There were a number of trails we looked at on the map and were itching to ride, but since they were so far out of the way, it would've required a full day to try just a couple trails with a lot of pedaling. So, with the shuttle day, we got a much easier way about it, and were really looking forward to it.</p>

    <p>We ended up with a pretty fun group, Germans, Swiss, Aussies, and our awesome crazy Italian driver, and we loaded up for a great day. The first trail, Issalo Exstacy, was incredible. Raw, natural, and fun as hell. Thankfully, so were all of the trails that day! Beautiful views on an incredible peak, natural trails, and a ridiculously bumpy, windy (and official) road up to the top every time. That was always made a little easier watching our tour guide (Chicho) talk with his hands. The expressive Italian stereotype holds fairly true.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/mJ4trvmh.jpg" alt="Stefan's Door"></img>

    <p>Unfortunately, on the last run, the guy at the end of our train took a wrong turn. We stopped at some point to re-group, but he never showed up... Long story short, he ended up just riding all the way back to his hotel (since his bag and phone were in the shuttle rig), and we all spent an hour looking for him before heading to the pickup. Thankfully all was well, and what a great day of riding!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lkGx9Gzh.jpg" alt="Waiting Game"></img>

    <p>Tuesday I opted for a rest day. The weather said it was supposed to remain sunny and then get cloudy the rest of the week, so I took the chance to get a walkabout in Finale under the sun while I could. This was also the first time I was able to get out and about with my new camera! That started off weird as before I even left the hotel, I couldn't figure out what was going on with the zoom. Took me a while, but I'd set up the auto-focus to be activated with a different button than what I was used to, but got that squared away and was off.</p>

    <p>Not to bore anyone, but I had a nice stroll through town to the beach, and then took a left away from town for a bit to explore the beach and cliffside. Beautiful spot there. I wandered along the each for a ways until I came to a marina, then doubled back and then headed into the pedestrian area of Finale Ligure. Wandered around there for a bit, found some postcards and stamps, and then headed up to Finalborgo to walk around the fortress area there. Was a little aimless, but made my way up to the for above town (it was closed), then back down to Finalborgo, then back to Finale Ligure, and by that point I was pretty hungry. But here are a bunch of pictures from that lovely little jaunt through town.</p>

    <p>Once I was back in Finalborgo, I was a bit aimless on where I wanted to eat, so I ended up at the main square to do somethinking/researching, and people watching to boot. I couldn't find a place I liked or one that was open, so I decided to meander back down to Finale Ligure. After some hemming and hawwing there, I walked along the boardwalk and randomly popped into a cafe along the beach for some lunch. The pasta and lemon soda were basic but definitely hit the spot. Then, after that, I knew just what was coming up.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/2iHjyvjh.jpg" alt="The Boardwalk"></img>

    <p>Right across the way was the ice cream parlor Stefan and I'd gone to the night before, and my sweet tooth wasn't going to pass up another go at some incredible gelato. I got a scoop of the chocolate and one of the strawberry, and then posted up at a table outside to write some postcards and even got myself a little espresso to go with it. Not quite affogato, but damn it was delicious. Once I wrapped up my postcards and went into pay, I double dipped and got myself another come. Treat Yoself.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/GBhqTwEh.jpg" alt="Chocolate Gelato"></img>

    <p>From there it was a slow walk back down the boardwalk and back to the hotel for a nap. But that nap didn't last too long before I got a call from Stefan, who'd just wrapped up riding and was hanging out at the bike bar with Eric and Philipp. So I headed on down for a brew with the boys, and Stefan and I headed back there for dinner that evening. Really cool spot, with a bike shop, bar, and restaurant all in one. Great way and place to wrap up the day.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/J9NoIloh.jpg" alt="Stefan at Dinner"></img>

    <p>Wednesday, time for something special. Instead of rocking the trails directly in Ligure, we (at the initiative of Eric's planning) headed an hour west from Ligure to the little mountain town of Molini. From the day before we roped in Dane, the Aussie from the tour, and me, Stefan, and Dane motored on down the coast along the highway, and then weaved right into some really beautiful mountain valleys and through some really tight mountain towns. Bummer I had to drive, but damn what a gorgeous stretch. Even got lucky with the timing before the shut down the road to load an excavator.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/DAclgFah.jpg" alt="Excavator Loading"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SBrxlihh.jpg" alt="First Sight in Molini"></img>

    <p>Molini is a really tiny town at the bottom of the fork in a deep mountain valley. Gorgeous to say the least. We rolled in, parked, and slowly met up with the group. Our tour guide for the day, Albi, joined us and got in for a chat as we waited for Eric and Philip to roll in, then we headed down to their warehouse below town to get loaded up and ready to go!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/shKGLRnh.jpg" alt="Rupert in Molini"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/YmMLuabh.jpg" alt="Loading up!"></img>

    <p>Not sure of how such a tiny mountain town, tucked away from pretty much anything big, only about 20min as the bird flies from the French border, became a mountain bike hot spot. For reference, a town nearby, Sanremo, is known as a proving ground for Downhill (the big, burly mountain bikes) bikes. Molini, nearby, could be said to be pretty near that. Well, as it turns out, it started about 15-20 years ago between Alberto and three or four of his buddies, they just started building some trails. Started with a few, grew from there, and now there's an absolute mecca of trails all throughout the hillsides around Molini, all of which were built from him and his buddies. Absolutely incredible.</p>

    <p>Since we were there in February, winter was still going, and some of the trails were still closed due to weather (surprisingly enough, even though we were a stone's throw away from the Mediterranean, the mountains there are high up and winter hits despite the tropical vibe). Bummer, but Alberto assured and showed us, that even with the higher trails closed, there was easily a week's worth of riding we could embark on without repeating a trail. We were absolutely in for a treat!!!</p>

    <p>To start the day, the only thing that bummed me out was that I didn't have my camera. As soon as we set out from the warehouse, we jumped into some tiny roads and just started climbing up the hill. The whole way was absolutely gorgeous. Molini, down in the valley, is right below a beautiful town on top of the ridge, overlooking the valley split, and we had a great view of that the whole ride up. The first run we did was 3/4 up the hill, but I was astounded by the views on the shuttle ride up.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/qsTUJyuh.jpg" alt="Upper Molini"></img>

    <p>As for the riding, holy shit. What a mecca for mountain biking. DON'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS PLACE, but I cannot wait to go back. Raw, natural, steep, flowy, rocky, technical, it's got everything. And all from just a small group of builders, just insane!!! Alberto got us warmed up on a quick (almost 1.5mile) trail and hot damn I was hooked! Unfortunately, I was a little shaky on turns, feeling like I was gonna wash out the whole time, but I was ripping and roaring and enjoying every bit of it.</p>

    <p>Alberto gave us a wonderful tour through some incredible trails. Thankfully, with the shuttle, we got to start at the top. And the top for these trails is really high up. Most of the trails we were on were so long, we stopped a good 3-5 times in between to catch our breaths. Such awesome building and incredible stuff!!!</p>

    <p>We got in a good bunch of variety of the awesome dirt that graces the Molini area, and all of us were enjoying the time. Soon enough, it was time for a lunch break, so we rolled back on down to Molini and got treated to some delicious bites from the local bar. We got lucky, because they're normally closed on that day, but we got treated to an incredibly enjoyable time out in the sunlight with some great food and a relaxed midday break.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/30DyCKMh.jpg" alt="More Valley Views"></img>

    <p>After the break, it was time for some more riding. Back up the hill we went and were ready for some more shreddage. That first trail, we hit it pretty hard from the top, then got to a cool jump that they'd built, and we all agreed to take a look at it before jumping it. Nothing big, nothing crazy, and I've definitely hit some bigger jumps (see Black Rock Moon Booter) no problem. So I pushed my bike back up to the top to get the few berms entering the jump and I was ready to go.</p>

    <h2 id="Break">Putting the "Break" in Breaking In 2022</h2>

    <p>Well, I wasn't as ready as I thought I was. I even mentioned it to Stefan at the top, right before I dropped in. Every time I stop, take my time, and look at a jump, I get nervous. But if I just follow someone in and go for it, no sweat. Well, this jump was a good example of it.</p>

    <p>I hit the curves, hit the jump, and hit the air. No problem. All felt good. Then once I hit the ground, I'm not sure what quite went wrong. I might've taken a bad line, where my landing point was a bit off the trail in the leaves, but either way, my bike slide out from me, my body went horizontal, and my momentum carried me straight for a tree. Good thing I was wearing a full face helmet, right! Right? Well, yeah-no (jein). Since my body was parallel to the ground, the chin guard was vertical, and I selected a tree that was just small enough to fit right into the opening of the helmet (see the right-most tree of the group). Sweet.....</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/kPyOEuDh.jpg" alt="The Tree that Won"></img>

    <p>Naturally, it all happened so fast, but I hit the tree and knew I wasn't in good shape. Could feel some liquid and knew it was blood, so immediately ripped off my glasses to rip off my helmet and just looked at the ground to try and stabilize. Shaken, shook up, and shocked, but I felt like everything was fairly ok despite a little head pain.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the blood on the leaves was the first sign that wasn't quite the case. Long story short, my face hurt, my glasses were broken, and I was pretty sure things weren't great. Once everyone huddled around me, the dust started to settle and I got a better idea of where I stood. Upon impact, the left lens of my glasses (yes, I need saftey glasses, working on it...) shattered. Some/one of the pieces wreaked havoc on my face and put in a good gash right under my left eye, and then right on the bridge of my nose. To add to it, I could tell my bones were tender, and thought I might've broken my orbital bone, but found out later I just broke my nose. Thankfully no loss of memory (no concussion), but I was in not-so-great shape. Needless to say, my riding day was over.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/l7bztFXh.jpg" alt="Cut and Smilin'"></img>

    <p>All the dudes along the ride were super patient, and a huge shoutout to Dane, Stefan, Albi, Eric, and Philipp for doing what they could to clean me up, patch me up, and make sure I was ok. Unfortunately with that crash that meant the rest of the group was just hanging around til I was either ready to ride or ready to get out of there. Well, they cleaned me up, and Dane had some med supplies on him as they tried to bandage me up as best they could. But Albi called our shuttle driver (aka (we think) his girlfriend), and she came to the nearest spot on the road to pick me up and take me back down to town in the hopes that the town's doctor could take a look at me.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/lFlJX28h.jpg" alt="Bandaged Blindness"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/JNmpyr2h.jpg" alt="Bloody Leaves"></img>

    <p>Thankfully she could speak Italian, and she pointed me in the right direction of where the doc would be. Turns out he was gone and would hopefully be back soon. With that, I had the gal just drop me off - I didn't want her to waste her time waiting with me when the other guys were off and riding. So she headed back to keep shuttling and I played the waiting game.</p>

    <p>It was a bit nippy, but I hung out on one side of the street in a bit of a wind shadow, and two older gentlemen, who I assume were also waiting for the doc, were watching me from the other side of the street. They could see I was waiting, and said a few things in Italian, and I gathered that to either mean it was 5 min til the doc came back, or I was the 5th person in line to see him. Either way, I had to keep waiting.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ty4tQtDh.jpg" alt="Helmet Hung Up"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/nVFf6hVh.jpg" alt="My Italian Helpers"></img>

    <p>Another huge shoutout to those two dudes, because they let me know it was my turn to go in and see the doc. Speaking only Italian, he let me know I would need stitches, and I probably had a broken nose. With that, that meant my next stop was the hospital. Once he cleaned me up a little more and put on a different bandage, I walked back to the car, and got the call that the rest of the group was done and congregating at the warehouse, so I headed on down.</p>

    <p>They were all super jazzed from the rest of the trails (and I was stoked they were, just bummed I wasn't there for it). Awesome to hera they rounded out the day so well, and so stoked we were able to come to Molini for some awesome trail guidance (and building) from Alberto! But we paid, packed up our bikes, and for me, it was off to the hospital. Instead of taking the one right near Molini, we ventured towards Finale Ligure and headed to Finale Pietra, and Stefan and Dane dropped me off at Hospital Santa Corona (fitting, I'd say considering this damn pandemic). From there, it was time to wait.</p>

    <p>T + 00:00 = Checked-in and hoping that I was ok. Nurse told me to go sit in the waiting room and wait to be called.</p>

    <p>T + 02:30 = First actual consultation. The nurse (reminded me of someone I know) thankfully spoke a little english. After listening to my situation, the crash, and what I was feeling, she sent me off to get an X-ray of my face.</p>

    <p>T + 02:35 = X-rays were taken. The dude just moved me around to whatever orientations and angles he needed of my face (including gaping like a fish with your head thrown back for the last one), then sent me back to the first consult nurse.</p>

    <p>T + 02:38 = Caught the nurse with her mask down (can't blame her having to wear a mask for hours and hours upon end). She couldn't do anything for me so she sent me to another new waiting spot to sit and wait.</p>

    <p>T + 03:24 = First consult nurse informed me I've officially got a broken nose. Didn't say anything about the orbital bone, but the plastic surgeon was on the way to re-set the bones and give me some stitches.</p>

    <p>T + 04:38 = To the operating room. The plastic surgeon (and all of the nurses there on hand) spoke little to no english. What I gathered was I'd get some local anesthesia for the stitches, and nothing for re-setting the bone.</p>

    <p>T + 04:47 = apparently "tampon medication" is a legit medical term here.</p>

    <p>T + 05:46 = ya boy is done with the operation. The stitches were a bit painful, but those got taken care of pretty quick. The whole re-setting the nose though? Holy shit that was a bitch. Painful as shit as they shoved something up each nostril, then jostled it around until apparently the bone was in the right spot. Dear jeebus that was painful. Coming out of that, I was informed I have a tampon up each nostril, and had to keep them in place for at least three days. Additionally, I had a metal plate over the bridge of my nose and that was supposed to stay in place. Then for the stitches, I shouldn't be getting them wet for the next while, and all of those things needed to be swapped out in a week.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VzMZfbch.jpg" alt="Post-Op Nial"></img>

    <p>T + 05:48 = I got sent back to the waiting room for observation, because as soon as they started the OP, my blood pressure dropped like an anchor. So they'd given me a saline IV and wanted to make sure I was ok and stable before releasing me.</p>

    <p>T + 06:12 = I ended up getting impatient (me?!?!) and released myself. I was feeling fine, and was eager to get out of there, and just uncomfortable as shit without the ability to breathe through my nose, and the pressure everything was putting on that broken bone between my eyes.</p>

    <p>So, roughly 6 hours after arriving, I was finished with the operation and fully re-built according to the doctor's assessment. Needless to say I wasn't pain-free, but I was happy to be out of there and on my way. Unfortunately, at that point in time, it was 02:30 in the morning. But Stefan, being the awesome friend he is, had agreed to have me call him to come pick me up. So I gave him a call, walked to the meeting spot, and posted up in the middle of the mediterranean night, feeling a bit under the weather.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Hgcx4pnh.jpg" alt="Hospital Corona"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/sFkYTalh.jpg" alt="Pickup Meeting Spot"></img>

    <p>Back to the hotel (Thank you Stefan for picking me up!), and time to crash, trying not to sleep on my face and keep my head elevated. Not necessarily an easy task.</p>

    <p>Thankfully I got some sleep, but I was still tired and recovering from the whole hospital experience. Needless to say, there was no riding in store for me that day, and at that point, I was trying to figure out how/when I was going to get home. Since the crash broke my glasses, and I had this giant hunk of metal on my nose, I didn't have any glasses to wear so I could see the world clearly, and that had me a bit worried about the drive home.</p>

    <p>After getting in a few naps in the morning and recovering a bit more, I had a plan to leave the next day (Friday) as soon as the sun came up. That way, during day light, I'd be able to see as best I can and hopefully have enough time to make it home before sunset. That was the plan, and with that squared away, mid-afternoon I finally got outside to get some fresh air. First stop was to the pharmacy to get my pain meds and antibiotics (wasn't sure why I was prescribed antibiotics for this...). Then I walked out to the pier to sit, get some ocean air, and just slow down a bit with all that I'd just been through. Also, trying to figure out what the hell that excavator was trying to accomplish moving all that sand around...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/H1F5QtYh.jpg" alt="Playing in the Sand"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xY8zmWKh.jpg" alt="Down the Beachline"></img>

    <p>Once I'd gotten my fill of sitting there, and was tired enough for another nap, I headed back to the hotel to crash for another round. Waking up I got an inquiry from Stefan and the gang asking how I was doing, and asking if I wanted to join for dinner that night. Although my nose was blocked closed like Fort Knox, I could thankfully still taste things, so I was in.</p>

    <p>I kept resting before it was time to head out, then headed down to meet Stefan. Thankfully, he was cool with driving over, as I wasn't feeling good enough to drive myself or bike, and we jumped in his wheels and headed over to Finalborgo to meet up with Eric and Philipp at yet another quaint, comfy, tiny Italian restaurant. Can't remember the name of this place, but it was right at the entrance to the old town of Finalborgo.</p>

    <p>Walking in and getting all the weird looks, and jabs of fun from Eric and Philipp, was something I was gonna have to get used to. But it was nice to sit with the gang, chat about the great ride they'd had that day (bummed I missed out), and just shoot the breeze. We'd stumbled upon quite the cool restaurant, and after discussion, we all opted in to go for the chef's tasting menu. Time for another culinary treat!</p>

    <p>And needless to say, it was absolutely fantastic. I can't remember each and every one of the 7 courses, but they were all unique, flavorful, impeccably presented, and a burst of wonderful, unique, and amazing tastes. But here's the coup d'grax. Me, Eric, and Philipp went in together on a bottle of wine. We got the wine, the lovely waitress doled it out, and I went in for a sniff (as I always do) before tasting it. Kinda forgot that I had to giant plugs up each of my nostrils, so smelling wasn't gonna happen...</p>

    <p>But to feast your eyes, here was our dinner in order of the courses:</p>

    <p>Some kind of green soup. Surprisng at first, but delicious</p>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BVVl5yKh.jpg" alt="Green Soup"></img>
    <p>Champignon cream soup with pioppini, mollet egg, hazelnuts, and ricotta cheese</p>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/24cbsHfh.jpg" alt="Mushroom Soup"></img>
    <p>Turnips, pears, baby spinach, and vinaigrette with lemon and olives</p>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/4F2Ophvh.jpg" alt="Turnip Salad"></img>
    <p>Artichoke and Jerusalem artichoke salad with pork tongue and ears</p>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/tUyy6CCh.jpg" alt="Artichoke salad"></img>
    <p>Risotto woth borage, peas, and goat's mile cheese</p>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/s6BlQU5h.jpg" alt="Risotto"></img>
    <p>Can't quite remember, but some kind of pork with spinach and artichokes</p>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/GHPkpMMh.jpg" alt="Pork"></img>
    <p>Ricotta and Orange Tart</p>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/a7Xh9Yah.jpg" alt="Dessert"></img>

    <p>Needless to say, that was one helluva feast.</p>

    <p>Towards the end I was getting really tired, but I am REALLY bad at speaking up for myself in social situations when I want out. I mean REALLY bad. But soon enough the wine was gone and everyone else was set to go. As we were paying, the lovely waitress explained to us how the chef comes up with a new menu every few days, all depending on what he's able to find for ingredients at the local markets. Pretty damn cool to be able to taste someone's total creativity and delicious results!!!</p>

    <p>Back to the hotel it was time to pack up a little bit, make sure everything was good to go, and then hit the sack.</p>

    <p>Waking up after some more pretty meh sleep, I got up and at 'em and headed out to the car with my stuff. Hit a bit of a snag because the bike locker at the hotel was locked, and I didn't know when someone would open it, as the contact number was not being answered. But my 07:00 departure was pushed back to 07:30 when the cleaning lady unlocked the gate. With the bike on the roof, it was time to get going.</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Quick Hit:</strong>You really don't realize just how much you rely on vision correction (glasses), until you have to go without them. As the days went on, and the pain started to dwindle with the nose and stitches, the pain in my eyes kept going just not being able to focus on things and having that strain a constant bug.</p>

    <p>I was on the road by around 07:45, and had the intention of just plugging straight through. Thankfully, the roads were playing well with me in that sense, as I just churned through the miles, and the weather stayed warm, sunny, and clear for me the whole way. Before I knew it I was through Milan and at Como, ready to cross over to Switzerland. But before I did, I found myself a grocery store to stock up on some Lemon Sodas (they're delicious), some chocloates, and a few things. Then, with a gas fuel up right across the border in Switzerland, I was back on the road.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/m5tRzEEh.jpg" alt="Plugged and Plugging Along"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XCczmUsh.jpg" alt="Patrol Packed Up"></img>

    <p>From there, it was another straight shot (over 4-5hrs) home. No traffic through Gotthard Tunnel, through Basel, or anywhere (even through Germany!?!?), and soon enough I rolled up home and got to unpacking. I was tired, pretty wiped out, and still in some pain and discomfort, but at least I was home.</p>

    <p>Only thing I did on Saturday was head to the frisbee club fields to meet up with Guzzer, Foxi, and Carli, after Foxi and Carli were done with their apartment hunting (they're moving back to Karlsruhe! Woot!). There I got some friendly jokes about what a freak I looked like, but also some helpful information about the unbelieveably luxurious health system we have in Germany. More on that to come.</p>

    <p>I was really, really looking forward to Sunday so I could go to the hospital to get my nostril tampons removed and be able to breathe again. So after waking up, getting cleaned up, and pedaling over, I'd made it to the Städtisches Klinikum Karlsruhe (city hospital) to get treated.</p>

    <p>First stop - Emergency Room. Got checked in and cleared the covid protocols, but before I even got acclimated, I was told by the check-in lady to head over to the Emergency Clinic (apparently different), so I walked on over to that different area.</p>

    <p>Second stop - Emergency Clinic. There I got checked in, gave them my information, then headed to the waiting room. After some kinda melancholy/tired waiting, the doc brought me back. Before I could really say anything, his reaction was, "Oh my Gosh. Do you need to be krankgeschrieben (written sick)?" Well, yeah, if you're offering, I sure as shit will take you up on that.</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Cultural Tidbit:</strong> Germans have NO fucking idea how good they have it on so many fronts. One of which is their health system.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">To be krankgeschrieben (written sick) is essentially to have a doctor's not stating you can't work for whatever time period they prescribe. This isn't something where you lose sick days, pay, or anything else. But this is a legal setup where you are not able/allowed/forced to work in the time period the doc writes you off, and in addition you're still paid as normal.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">So talking with the doc, essentially he wrote me up sick from the date of the accident (T minus four days), and then through the whole coming week. That came out to me essentially me going from having one week of vacation, to having two days of vacation, and then 8 days of sick leave. This German system is absolutely insane.</p>

    <p>The very nice and friendly doc listened to what happened to me, wrote me up sick as well as gave me a few more pain med prescriptions, but then said I was still kinda in the wrong place, and had to head over to the HNO (Hals-Nase-Ohren / Ear Nose and Throat Doc / Ohnorinolyringologist) Clinic to actually be helped, and most importantly, get the nostril tampons taken out. So off I went.</p>

    <p>In circling over, I picked up my bike, pedaled over, and walked into yet another hospital building, where I was greeted by a guy to check covid protocols and make sure I was in the right place. With his blessing I skipped registration and just headed up to the HNO Clinic. But once I got there, the door was locked. I knocked, and a very unsure looking nurse eventually opened up so I could explain my situation, then let me in to their little waiting room.</p>

    <p>A little bit of paperwork, a little bit of waiting, and after the other patient was done, I was ushered back to their little examination room. Thankfully I could converse with this doctor and nurse no problem (lack of a language barrier really helps), and they slowly got to work on my situation.</p>

    <p>First they asked a bunch of questions about the crash, how I was feeling, what was done to me, etc. Then the relief I was waiting for, pulling out the giant nose plugs. That wasn't comfortable at all, but finally being able to breathe out of my nose again, holy shit what a relief. Hard to explain how uncomfortable and annoying it is, for three days, having to pop your ears every time you swallow, always having to breathe out of your mouth, and a number of more discomforts that come with it, but finally having that air channel back open for business was a HUGE relief.</p>

    <p>As soon as they were pulled out, A) I was astounded at just how damn huge they were, and B) I had to keep a little tray under my nose in case there was still a bunch of bleeding to come. Thankfully, things looked to have healed up pretty good in the preceding three days, and blood was pretty minimal. The doc then took some tools and devices to look up and into my nose and see how things actually looked, and her prognosis was good. That was a nice relief.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/GBNHNr5h.jpg" alt="My Nostril Tampons"></img>

    <p>They then proceeded to give me the details on next steps, verify the Italian report that I got from the hospital down in Finale Pietra, and soon enough, they were all finished up with me. Not more than an hour tops, and I was in out of all three places with a new lease on being able to breathe through my nose and feeling good about the healing process.</p>

    <h2 id="Sick">Krankgeschrieben - A Weird Week</h2>

    <p>Sunday was relaxed, and after coming back from the hospital, I knew I had a week that I was not required to work, and to add to that, I knew that on Thursday I'd already planned another trip on the books. I guess it wasn't guaranteed, but I knew I had a bit of a weird week ahead of me. First things first, I let my boss know the status, that I'd be out for the week (not just Friday as originally planned), but I'd try and plug in to work for important topics if they came up. That didn't hold quite true, as I was really enjoying the not-having-to-work aspect of things, but I was tuned in for a bit of it.</p>

    <p>First thing on Monday I got a number of doctor's appointments squared away. For sure I needed to get my stitches out, then I needed to get my teeth checked (they'd been feeling weird since the crash), and to my HNO (Ear-Nose-Throat) doc for an overall check-up and changing the bandages. Those were scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, so I had a few days to kinda kill.</p>

    <p>How'd I end up killing that time? Well, a good bit of sleeping (as much as I could manage with the weird thing on my nose), to give my body time to recover, but primarily to rest my eyes. I'd taken my old glasses with the old prescription, removed the nose pads, and was able to use those over the metal nose plate, but they were not in the right position and still caused some eye strain just to focus. But they were a good band-aid when needed.</p>

    <p>The other big thing I did was play video games. Kinda dumb, considering the eye pain, but I'd just gotten Horizon Forbidden West downloaded, and holy shit what a fun game. Part movie, part board game, with an awesome open world and tons of things to get into, that really kept (and is keeping) me occupied through the times. Not a bad way to go.</p>

    <p>Fast forward to Wednesday, and among some other errands I needed to get done, I headed to the dentist to get my teeth checked. He did a good once-over (no x-rays), and after tugging at all the teeth and putting something ice cold on them, said everything looked good. Happy to know that despite the weird pains I was having there, all was good to go!</p>

    <p>Then on Thursday, had a nice little double-whammy. First I went to my general doctor to get my stitches removed. They were quick like lightning with it, and before I knew it, the stitches were out and he even said everything looked like it was healing pretty well. Just have to keep my face out of the sun until December or so so that the scarring doesn't discolor or anything, but all-in-all, the stiches looked to have done their job!</p>

    <p>Right after that, I was off to my HNO Doc (Ear/Nose/Throat) to get the nose plate swapped and make sure everything was good on the nose front. I've been to this gal a few times, and I think she recognizes me by know. I think she's from Bulgaria, so we're able to converse in both English and German pretty well. To start, she pulled off the existing nose cover, and looked everything over. Yet again, another pretty clean bill of healing, and she said things looked pretty good.</p>

    <p>What the HNO Doc at the hospital on Sunday had told me was that I needed to get my bandages swapped once a week for the next couple weeks, which was on the docket for this HNO Doc visit. When I told her that though, she kinda just laughed at me and said that's dumb. The Hospital doc said it takes about a year for the bone to set and be fully healed, but the local HNO doc said that's ludicrous, and that the bone really sets after a week. It takes a lot longer to fully heal, but after a week everything's in its place.</p>

    <p>Long story short, I got out of there with a thumbs up on how everything is healing, and doctor's orders to NOT wear the roman nose plate! Hot damn! Couldn't have drawn that up any better! So although the scratches were still pretty prominent, I was back to normal-ish, and could finally wear glasses in a normal way. No joke, that itself was an absolute life-saver.</p>

    <p>Also during that week, I got a lovely, wonderful care package from my Mommy full of Belgian coffee and goodies, discovered the cups that Zack stole in Porto that he'd stashed somewhere in Rupert, and realized my corkboard is overflowing with cards and postcards! Gonna have to take time soon to clear that off and re-set. But what a joy to look back on all the love sent to me from all over the place. :-)</p>

    <h2 id="Batumi">A Balmy Weekend in Batumi</h2>

    <p>Thursday was a pretty full day. Once my doctors appointments were over and done, I was back at home on the beautiful sunny day to finish packed to get ready to head East! After a couple years of wanting to make it happen and trying to find a time, I finally pulled the trigger to plan on meeting up with my buddy who'd moved to Georgia. So I got all my things packed and jumped into Rupert to head to STR to get on the way!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uCuY0HZh.jpg" alt="Bags Packed and Ready"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/o0iiQxfh.jpg" alt="Escalator to Terminal"></img>

    <p>Unfortunately, with my flight plan, I had a 14-hour overnight layover in Istanbul. I initially thought about using that and going to explore town, but put the kaibosh on that pretty quick. Thankfully, I had access to the big lounge in the airport, so when I got in I found a comfy-ish place to lay back and try and get some sleep. That worked out kinda ok, and after a bit of sleep, some more waiting and walking around (IST is a MASSIVE airport...), it was wheels up and down to Georgia!</p>

    <p>Landed, got my passport stamped, and soon enough got to see Eric there waiting for me! Great to see him, as it'd been over a decade since the last time we'd seen each other! We quickly jumped in a taxi and headed back to his condo building. One of his buddies had a spare apartment available so I got to crash in my own spot for the weekend. Once I was settled, we were off and into town for the night to start catching up.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/88rcQ1ih.jpg" alt="Hello Batumi"></img>

    <p>First stop was a little bar near downtown - Conte. There Eric showed me the local popular liquor, Cha Cha, so we snagged a couple of those and got to chatting. Crazy that he's been over in Eastern Europe (over a year in Georgia, then Albania, and back to Georgia) for around two years. Got to hear a bit more about what he's been up to in that time, what gave him the idea to move over to this side of the world, and a lot of what's been going on for him.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XhVbdfgh.jpg" alt="Conte Cha Cha"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/jsKyvKeh.jpg" alt="Bar Doggy"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/F2ugrLQh.jpg" alt="235 and Georgian Script"></img>

    <p>After a few rounds of Cha Cha, it was time for some food. We headed over to the local German beer hall, and settled in for some grub. Eric did the ordering, and soon enough we essentially a cheese pizza, but it wasn't a pizza. Some Georgian flatbred filled with cheese. It was delicious, especially with the green and red sauces that came with it. Bomb deliciousness to kick off my exposure to the Georgian cuisine - a very good sign of things to come.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/O2xPPwch.jpg" alt="Cheesy Goodness"></img>

    <p>From there, we headed to the local expat's bar, Mary's Pub. Eric knew the owners, a friendly Scottish guy and a Russian gal, so we rolled in, got to meet them, then grabbed some beers and headed upstairs to chat some more. We ended up spending a good amount of time there, but at some point I got pooped and was ready for some sleep. Eric was still going strong, so he snagged me an uber and I headed back to sleep and he kept the increasingly snowy and cold night a'rollin.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZRntMqYh.jpg" alt="Mary's Pub"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/GCPUcMph.jpg" alt="Snow in Batumi"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/EXg9YeYh.jpg" alt="A Nightime Doorway"></img>

    <p>That next morning I was up fairly early. First thing, head to the local convenience store for some TP. Weird that there was none there, but got to give me a look at what's common to find in your nearby 7-11. Interesting stuff!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/mj37Fhhh.jpg" alt="On the Streets"></img>

    <p>Before long Eric was up, and we headed to town to grab some breakfast. That took us to a little cafe downtown where we grabbed some grub (some good eggs benny) to start off the day. Unfortunately, the weather had remained pretty shitty, and snow was coming down pretty good all morning. We weren't sure what to do, so after breakfast we just headed back to the apartments to see what we could get into.</p>

    <p>After some hanging around and see what Batumi had to offer for activities in shitty weather, our first stop was the cable car. This left straight from the middle of town and transported you up and over the city to the local peak. In town, it was wet and grey, but getting up to the peak - it was socked in snow.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vaQKHyfh.jpg" alt="Batumi Town"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/rgGyChCh.jpg" alt="Batumi Peak"></img>

    <p>We stumbled around out in the white wonderland for a bit, but then headed in to the cafe at the peak to hang out for a while. The folks in there were super nice, and I snagged myself a glass of Georgian wine and some cake. The recipe to stay warm and enjoy the little break.</p>

    <p>Eric had an Ohrwurm of Bani, a local Georgian band, and put in a request for one of their songs to the waitress. At some point it came on, and there was another Georgian couple there, and the gal started going into an impromptu dance! Looked really intricate and traditional, and soon enough her guy joined in with her. So with some Bani on the jukebox, we got to experience (what I assume to be) a traditional Georgian dance and th good laughs of all the folks in the kitchen to go with it. Really a cool little impromptu experience!</p>

    <p>Once we were all wrapped up and satiated there, we headed back down the cable car into down and tried to decide what else we could do to stay out of the rain and snow. After some debate and discussion, we landed on heading over to the fish market. That took us over to a very non-touristy and industrial part of town. Immediately we were overrun with some dudes trying to sell their restaurant/fish/etc., and I got the vibe we shouldn't have come.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/TKgR7Iah.jpg" alt="Fish Market Streets 1"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iUVsKtvh.jpg" alt="Fish Market Streets 2"></img>

    <p>But we ventured into the market anyways, I was just intent on a look around. It was a pretty small market, so that walk around went by pretty quick. I was ready to dip and get out of the weird vibe, but Eric shared he was up for some shrimp. I was a bit confused, as he'd kept saying he hated fish, but I stupidly equated fish to all seafood, and that was not fair. So long story short, we ended up getting some shrimp, and walked back to one of the hustler dudes on the street, and they set us up with a restaurant to get our shrimps cooked and yummy.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/JDYDheth.jpg" alt="Shriiiiimps"></img>

    <p>Geedangit, they did a damn good job of it. It was only a bummer that we didn't get more shrimp, because that shit was delicious. We scarfed those down, and Eric did the same thing with the Bani song from before, but I don't think it came on. Once we finished those shrimp up, it was back towards town and off to the Archaeological Museum.</p>

    <p>No joke, this was quite the cool museum. First off, after we paid our admission and got some helpful pointing in the right direction from the staff, were a couple skulls from our early hominid ancestors that were dug up nearby. I don't remember seeing an estimated age, but they were clearly not homo-sapiens, and this was just the tip of a bunch of really ancient relics that had been excavated throughout Georgia and the Adjaran region (the State in which Batumi is located).</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ORRFmD4h.jpg" alt="Ancient Cousins"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QsOqT9Bh.jpg" alt="Museum Hall"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/OIghzeAh.jpg" alt="Georgia Discovery Seas"></img>

    <p>We cruised around the museum and got to see tons of pots, cups, pottery, and so much other artifacts that had been discovered through digs in the local area. Pretty impressive to see how much has been discovered in the small country of Georgia! We finished cruising around the museum, and once finished, headed back to the apartments.</p>

    <p>Around that time, I was getting a bit of a different vibe from Eric, and wasn't quite the big fan of it. He was drinking pretty consistently at every place we stopped, and I could tell he was pretty drunk. The content of conversation deteriorated pretty notably, and I just wasn't feeling the vibe. I passively called him out on it, and he got very defensive very quick. I didn't fly out to Georgia to hang out with a total drunk, but that's what it had kinda come to. Long story short, we had a bit of a falling out, and that was kinda the end of our weekend together.</p>

    <p>I struggled with how to react to all of this. He's got a much more extensive background and things he's gone through in his life that I can't comprehend. I was doing my best to be cognizant of that, but the immature nature of the conversation and his perceived reliance on alcohol to get through the day and deal with what's going on was not something I was really ok with. I've got some more detailed opinions and assessment of the situation, but that's more personal than what I'd like to go into.</p>

    <p>What that meant though, was that although I'd come to Georgia to see him, my visit had turned into a solo adventure. Quite the bummer, shock, and unexpected/weird change, but those were the cards I was now dealt with. Getting back to the apartment, he also told me that he screwed up letting his buddy know when I was going to be there, and had to find a new place to stay for my last night in town. A weird wrinkle, but that's just how it went.</p>

    <p>I ended up bumming around the apartment for a good part of the afternoon, and at some point the rain and snow abated for a while, so I popped out onto the balcony to take some pictures of the mountains behind town to my left and the Black Sea to my right.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/d0IkUUTh.jpg" alt="Unfinished Construction and Mountains"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/hhLpnrZh.jpg" alt="Tower at the Black Sea"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/t1UDHFmh.jpg" alt="Apartments Down Below"></img>

    <p>Hunger slowly crept up and made itself known. Although the rain was gone, I was kinda ready to just stay in and wake up in the morning. But eventually my stomach got loud and my mentality of movement kicked into gear, so I ventured out into town to find some grub.</p>

    <p>The place I'd scoped out wasn't too far away, and it took me initially through the majorly developed row of skyscrapers, then into a more subdued area of town. Soon enough I rolled up to Batumarani, found a spot, and was ready to enjoy what I could of the night.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/asHux5Lh.jpg" alt="Batumi at Night"></img>

    <p>I had my book with me, so started to crank away on that as I also read the menu and decided on a local Georgian staple - Khachapuri. THe waiter was super nice, informed me it'd take a while, but I was patient and ready for some delicious food. Before long, my cheese bread boat showed up, and hot damn was it yummy! Talk about a carb-bomb, but damn that was some good, gooey cheese to go with the delicious flatbread boat. I can see why people love this entree. Perfect for a cold day to keep you warm and induce a thorough food coma!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yI8D6hfh.jpg" alt="Batumarani's Khachapuri"></img>

    <p>I got some good time reading in while eating and had a lovely little dinner. Once it was done, I paid and headed back out, and opted for a bit of an extended route back. That took me through a big park, along some residential streets, and past this weirdly space-agey McDonalds, before waltzing back to pass out for the night. I gotta say, it's gotta suck to live right next to the building I was staying in, see the lights...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/j4w62wPh.jpg" alt="Paper Airplane Flying"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/w5BbLYVh.jpg" alt="Purple Light Blanket"></img>

    <p>That night I got a good bit of sleep. Not sure if I was over tired, or just kinda apathetic and weirded out by the end of the day before. But I got some good rest and ended up getting out of bed pretty late. The thing that kicked me into gear was being informed that I needed to leave the room in a timely manner to prepare for the people that were arriving that day to stay in that apartment. So I got cleaned up and packed up, and as I was leaving was surprised to see Eric down there. We said goodbyes and I was off into town to find my place to sleep for my last night in town/country.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/GkMymOlh.jpg" alt="Not quite Packed"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/KHIVmXKh.jpg" alt="Snowy Batumi Streets"></img>

    <p>It was a good 20min walk or so in the wet snow and cold, but I eventually found the sidestreet and had to rely on my offline maps to point me in the right direction. Lucky I had that, because the place was quite tucked in there an not really visible, but with a faint sign on the sidewalk, I was pointed into a small courtyard that looked to be bare of notice that it was a place of lodging.</p>

    <p>Quite confused, and unsure if I was anywhere near close to being in the right place, I kinda poked around looking for signs of an establishment. First door was a kitchen, second a hallway, and then I walked the courtyard staircase hoping for more success. Thankfully, I opened the door and someone answered my call. But weirdly enough, I opened the door to the purveyor's living room.</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Quick Thought</strong>:  For some reason, as soon as 'business interactions' get more than transactionaln (i.e. more personal), I get a little weirded out. Going back to the Casa Particulare in Trinidad, Cuba, this situation slowly became a family welcoming me into their living room and home as I'm there to pay for a room and place to sleep. For me, it's a weird juxtaposition of a service transaction and a cultural exchange and chance to interact on a personal level. I don't know why, but I get a little uneasy/weirded out in such situations.</p>

    <p>The lady was super kind and welcomed me in after confirming that I had a reservation. As I was a bit of a last-minute booking, the room wasn't ready. So she welcomed me into their living room, as her kids were playing around and watching a Georgian cooking show or playing on their phones, and her husband seemed to be bouncing in and out. I sat on the couch and joined in as the Georgian Martha Stewart showed how to make Tiramisu with constant sips of her Coca-Cola to keep her going.</p>

    <p>Amidst all of this, the very kind lady offered me coffee as I waited. I felt like I totally barged in on their day, and felt bad, but was very grateful for the kind hospitality. That hospitality continued through the baklava that was on the table. And I gotta say, that was the best baklava I've ever had. Absolutely delicious.</p>

    <p>Continuing watching the tiramisu show and observing the family, eventually grandma came in with a few sweets and gifts for the kids and joined in on the watching. We had a small interaction that quickly jumped to the Ukraine War and how Russia is bad. Very adamant feelings, and I completely agreed with the scary and troubling situation, and for me it was interesting and reassuring to hear that mindset, especially in a country that is/was in a similar situation.</p>

    <p>Eventually, the nice lady came in after finishing getting the room ready, so I finished my coffee, thanked the family for their hospitality, and headed down to the room. Once there, I got a bit situated, was surprised by an older gentlemen who welcomed himself into my room to say hi and leave, and then got my adventure bag ready to go walk around town. The weather was kinda shit, but I wanted to take advantage of the last few hours in town, despite the cold.</p>

    <p>From the hotel/lodging I headed out and headed north towards town. It was around/a little after midday at that point, and I was hungry. Stemming off the tips from the "What to do in Batumi with rainy weather" article I'd read before, I made my way off to an eatery that caught my eye. Eventually, my route took me up near the outside of downtown and off along a pretty evident shopping street. There were vendors setup all along the street, despite the rain/snow mix, and people bustling in a fairly subdued fasion.</p>

    <p>Keeping an eye on my map, I eventually made it to the storefront that matched the picture. I have no idea what the name of the place was, but I walked in and was greeted to a small dining area with a few tables and a few people strewn about, and an adjoining kitchen. I walked up, struggled to but eventually ordered three Khinkali, and found a place to sit. I guarantee I was being watched the whole time (as I yet again stuck out like a sore thumb, I can be good at that), and waited.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/stQP8ADh.jpg" alt="Khinkali Ludi"></img>

    <p>It was a bit steamy in the shop, but damn it smelled good. I was eventually joined at my table by another guy, and I sat further in decent silence as I waited. Eventually, my target, goal, and culinary delight arrived. Khinkali are essentially dumplings, but a little soupy, and hot as shit. The kinda kitchen lady dropped them off at the table, and I was unsure of how they're normally attacked, but grabbed my utensils, and the shaker jar of whatever spice was on the table, and I was ready to go.</p>

    <p>HOLY SHIT did I stumble upon an absolute treat. Warm, flavorful, hearty, steamy, and downright fucking delicious. I dove into the first and was immediately in love with the killer dumpling thing right in front of me. Only regret was that I only ordered three!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZHxzMmzh.jpg" alt="Last Khinkali Dumpling"></img>

    <p>No lie, I was one happy camper slowly but eagerly snacking away on my Khinkali. Seriously, such a hearty meal with so much spice and flavor was an absolute treat to my tongue. I was really quite in the zone with my food, but during my meal the guy sitting across from me busted out a bit of his English (no hope for me and my Georgian... Sorry buddy...) and we had a quasi conversation! Delightful to see sparks of joy and curiousity from others, despite my language handicap in a foreign land.</p>

    <p>I savored every bit of the doughy, meaty, spicy, soupy goodness that was present in those incredible Khinkali. Seriously, what a damn good find. But as with all good food, eventually it was all gone. I was sad. But damn glad I stumbled upon such an incredible source of deliciousness!!!</p>

    <p>From the hole in the wall, it was time to head off and walk. I had my 'new' camera on me, and was ready to capture a few pictures of Beautiful Batumi in the cold, grey, snowy day. So off I was. Despite the wintery day, I had a nice time trying to stay warm while wandering around town. No joke, I would love to come back to Batumi, and Georgia as a whole, with a little better weather to wander around, experience the neature, and dive further into the culture here. But to summarize, here are abunch of pictures from my walk around town.</p>

    <p>Once it got too cold for me to handle any longer, I dove into town on the hunt for a warm place and a cold beer. Just my luck, there was a perfect spot for just that not too far away. And adding to my luck, it was a craft beer bar - Sami Ludi (Georgian for Three Beers). Can't go wrong with that!</p>

    <p>Walked in and got myself a delicious stout to start, and headed up to the small loft to dry off, warm up, and take a nice load off. The beer was fantastic, and local, and another nice safe-haven from the boring beer back in Deutschland. I took my time and made this a nice, long pit-stop. A couple thick, dark beers, a good bit of reading (my essentially vacation-only activity, still need to change that), and some absolutely killer cheese balls of sorts. Really awesome place to stop off and relax.</p>

    <p>From my delicious beers and cheese balls, I was back out and walking. There was still a little daylight left, and although I as a little aimless, I continued to stroll through the main part of downtown, then made my way back out to the shoreline of the Black Sea as the sun continued its journey down. It was a crisp evening, so I soaked up what I could as I walked along.</p>

    <p>My walk slowly wound me back to my room at the guest house, and I got in and took a load off. After some sitting/napping around, I got some packing down, and then decided to pop back out to find some dinner. Soon enough, I'd finished that up, was pooped from the day, and came back to hit the sack.</p>

    <p>The next morning was time for my flight back home, and I was kinda ready for it. Weird trip, some unexpected revelations, and despite being in a new country I would absolutely love to explore, the trip was short and I didn't have a lot of time to be able to dive into it as I would've liked. With my stuff all packed, I headed out from the friendly guesthouse, and started walking toward the airport. I still had a a few Lari on me, but was trying to save some money for some reason.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I was tired of walking, kept looking at my watch every couple minutes, and was ready to get to the airport to make sure I didn't miss my flight. At the next big intersection, I snagged myself a taxi, settled on a good price, and we were off. What would've taken me another at least 40min to walk took a good 5 in the car. I jumped out, grabbed my stuff, and shortly thereafter was all checked in and through security. I wasted my last few Lari on some oreos and a drink, and soon enough, we were boarding and headed back West.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3zLRj35h.jpg" alt="Batumi off the Wing"></img>

    <p>A quick (compared to the trip there) layover in Istanbul with some coffee and people-watching, and soon enough I was back up in the air and headed to back to Stuttgart. I was pretty enthralled by a movie (either Dune or Tenet, both excellent films), but when I opened the window I was just catching the tail end of the Alps! Beautiful scenery, as always. Then shortly thereafter, we flew right over Reutlingen, and old place I'd visited a few times, before landing back in Deutschland.</p>

    <p>As I mentioned, overally, it was a weirded trip than I anticipated. The country was fantastic - delicious, flavorful food; friendly people, beautiful nature (when not covered in clouds), and the impression of tons of history from many eras around every corner. It was weird though because of how things shook down between my buddy and I. Unexpected, and a bit of a bummer.</p>

    <p>Either way, I would LOVE to go back to Georgia. Batumi was just a taste, and I caught it on a cold stretch. The nature there is supposed to be incredible, and the excursion I had into the culinary side of life there only makes me want more! Not sure when that'll take place, but I look forward to jumping back into Georgia!</p>

    <h2 id="QuickWeek">A Quick Week</h2>

    <p>Once I got back to Germany, I only had a little over a week before my next big adventure. For the most part, that week was just filled with work and prep for the upcoming workshop. Blahblahblah work, same old same old.</p>

    <p>From the snippets of stuff that I do remember, I did a little grocery shopping to hold me over for the week, and while I was cruising through Kaufland in the beer section, I saw something that surprised me. The local main brewery does a Beer of the Month, where they try and branch out from the boring typical German beer selection. This one was interesting, because they were trying out an Imperial Stout. Dark, thick beers are not typical in Germany, but they're my favorite, so naturally I had to give it a try. One fine, beautiful night, I snagged a döner, had my Sky Valley Sriracha ready to go, and found out that they actually did a decent job with an Imperial Stout. Needless to say, I was surprised and happy.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/C2c9ls5h.jpg" alt="Döner and Stout"></img>

    <p>Last year, Europe was hit with a wall of sand that was blown up from the Sahara desert. I remember that, because I found that so absolutely crazy that sand from the middle of Africa had found its way up to Europe! Continental eart works isn't a normal thing, so seeing the sky tinted orange and sand all over the ground (and snow at that time) was quite a surprise.</p>

    <p>Well, as nature would have it, we had another go-round of Saharan Sand being blown up the hemisphere! It was a rainy day, and I was confused as to why things were getting so dark before sundown. Well, turns out a wall of sand can do a pretty good job blocking out the sun. By the end of the day, I got to see this coming out to Rupert to head home. Luckily enough it was just a few days after I'd gotten him all washed and cleaned up too...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lAyra7Mh.jpg" alt="Rupert - Sahara Sanded"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/nhnopfgh.jpg" alt="Rupert - Sahara Sanded"></img>

    <p>The main thing I did in that week was pack. Pack for what? My next trip back home! The workshop on the calendar was with the team back in Portland in Portland/Madras, and I was headed back for it along with two coworkers and my boss. I did my best getting some goodies and things prepped to take back, get everything packed and ready to go, and it slowly came together.</p>

    <p>One aspect of all of this was biking. Oh yeah, a couple months prior I'd put in an order for a new bike frame, and over those couple of months I'd done a ton of parts ordering to get everything ready to bolt on once the new frame had arrived. Long story short, it came that week, I started to build it up in the hopes of taking it with to the US, but made a dumb mistake on a crucial part that halted the whole build. That really pissed me off and bummed me out, but after some waffling I got to packing up my old new bike to get it ready to take home.</p>

    <p>The bike bag I've got is pretty wicked. I took my time getting used to it, as this was the first time I'd actually used it other than to move. It took a little time to figure out. But the thought put into getting a full mountain bike packed and snuggled up to protect it from plane flights and who knows what else is pretty ingenious. Soon enough, the Transition was strapped in and ready to go, and shortly thereafter, so was everything else! I got mad lucky with this too, because since work paid for the flights, it was Business class. And with Business class you get 70lbs. for check bags instead of 50lbs, and holy hell that makes a huge difference!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/PJBXZBch.jpg" alt="Bike and Suitcase Ready!"></img>

    <p>The night before I flew out was a Wednesday, which is the typical night I meet up with Christoph and Mischa. The weather was great, and Mischa was recovered from Covid but still not feeling fully fit, so we opted to use the good weather to have the first barbecue of the year in Mischa's garden. It was seriously a perfect day for it, and after I got all my last-minute prep work done for the trip, I headed to the grocery store to get the grilling goods, and was having a wonderful pedal through the sun and blue skies.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/G1MbvSoh.jpg" alt="Alb Bike Path"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/PrDfh0Gh.jpg" alt="Paper Boats Mural"></img>

    <p>The afternoon and evening was perfect for a grill-out, and it was great to see my buddies once again. It'd been a bit of a while since our last meetup, so catching up and hearing what'd been going on with each of them was nice. The meat was delicious, beers cold, and a great night was had. Such a great way to wrap things up in Germany before flying out. I didn't stay too long, as I had an early departure the next day, but time to hang out with friends is always a great way to fill up your soul.</p>

    <h2 id="HomeAgain">Home Trip 2022 - Constant Chaos in Motion</h2>

    <p>That next morning it was up at 03:00 to head out. I was flying out of STR and had the same deal where I had someone pick up my car from the terminal to park it somewhere for the 5 weeks I'd be back home. In the interest of brevity, I'm gonna make this portion just a spark notes explanation of what I actually all got into. More emphasis on what I was feeling and such rather than what I did. Not sure how that'll play out, but the goal is to make this not a novel but a brief roundup of what all went down. That sound gouda?</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/kTubo70h.jpg" alt="Thumbs Up and Ready to Go"></img>

    <p>To start, DeGaulle Airport sucks major ass. I'd never flown through there before, and their layout, flow, and just overall setup is just plain terrible. I got through it, had little time to spare, and eventually got into my lay-flat seat to soak in the luxury side of travel to get me back stateside.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VXeMl6Qh.jpg" alt="DeGaulle from Above"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QgUknB6h.jpg" alt="DeGaulle from Inside"></img>

    <p>As always, business class is fucking amazing. Good food, good wine, the ability to sleep, just fantastic.</p>

    <p>Every time flying back to the PNW is a fucking treat. What makes it better? When there are no clouds and blue skies out so you can see all the mountains :-)</p>

    <p>I got in town on a Thursday and since my flights were delayed, ended up just heading to the hotel to rest. Didn't get much sleep. But that's how it goes. Friday, I had to get up early and get a drug test done so I could be re-entered into the company driver pool. Once that was out of the way, I headed into my old office.</p>

    <p>Turns out, with VPNs and slow global internet connections, it takes about a half an hour for my german laptop to log-in in the US. After a while I was done with that and tired, so I headed out for an early lunch. Time to start the culinary side of the trip, and to kick things off, Khao Soy from Mee Dee Thai.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="" alt="Khao Soy"></img>

    <p>Next up, time to kick off the friend tour of the trip! Sam and Morgan live in the neighborhood, and I'd been itching to see them, so I just popped on over for a surprise! After shooting the breeze for a good bit and seeing how they were doing, Morgan headed out for some errands and Sam and I got our walk on, heading to Stormbreaker then Ex Novo to start the beer tour of the trip. Such a cool fucking dude, great beers, and a perfect day to wander around, chat about life, hard decisions, and big events, and see such a great friend!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="" alt="I Love Your Butt"></img><br>

    <p>Saturday was the kick off for the bike tour of the trip! Andy and Joel, one waiting on a child any day at that point, and the other with a lively 2-year-old were able to squeeze out a free morning to jump out with me to Sandy Ridge for some riding. It was a bit damp, but damn I forgot how great those trails are! Fast as shit flying down Two Turntables back on the trails with my buddies, I was happy as a clam to be home. Time to catch up with both of them and what's going on in their lives, time to get some beautiful PNW air, time to shred some incredible PNW dirt, just a great way to start the weekend.</p>

    <p>That night I headed down to SE to celebrate again with Sam for his birthday! Great timing to give the little kniving devil a few shots to celebrate - just what he likes! We killed some Ranch Pizza at Baerlic, then wandered around to a few bars before ending up at a patio on Hawthorne. Unfortunately, the night ended with a sour note as Kurdi gave Sam a bear-hug that turned into a pile driver, but all is well that ended well, kinda. Bummer to see the birthday boy down for the count to round things out. But I had a good time.</p>

    <p>Sunday, back on the bikes! This time, I headed over to Colin's place to join up with him, Clayton, and Lindsay! We got some big hugs and smiles in before loading up and heading out to Syncline on another beautiful day on the Gorge. I forgot how awesome those trails were too! We got in a couple laps, pet some gorgeous dogs, and enjoyed the beautiful day before Clayton ran into some drivetrain trouble, but hot damn what a great group of people on some great trails!</p>

    <p>After we got back to Portland and I got myself cleaned up, I was feeling some energy, so I grabbed my camera and did a walkabout my old hometown. The weather was muted but sunny, the cherry blossoms were a-blooming, and as always, it was a joy to feel my cool town. Damn I miss Portland. Continued the beer (Iceberg beer/margarita) and food (Mac & Cheese and a Fried Chicken Sammich) at Bunk Bar to add to the incredible culinary delights of my trip. Here's a bunch of pictures of town :-)</p>

    <p>Monday, back to work. I headed into the office for the day to get some stuff done, and my boss and coworker arrived that afternoon. After I wrapped up my stuff, they came down to HQ so I could give them a 'tour' (I hate being tour guide) before we headed to the hotel. They were up for a walk before dinner, so we toured around the Pearl District before heading to Deschutes for some beers and food. Dinner was great, and the beers were too, but that started my complete anger/frustration with my boss being there with his incredibly arrogant/German mindset just shitting on the US the entirety of his time there. Not a happy camper with that.</p>

    <p>Tuesday, it was off to Madras! A few meetings to start the day, then some lunch and off we headed back to my old stomping grounds. We roadtripped out there in true fashion and took the long route to include some great views of the gorge, the trucks, and the mountainous scenery. But with that, it was the start of the testing workshop. What does that mean? Long days, a good bit of driving, and good food and beer to wrap up each night. Just had to do my best to not have to deal with my annoying boss throughout it. Great to have my coworker balance things out who was actually trying to experience things and have some fun with the gang.</p>

    <p>As luck would have it, I was able to break away one evening to head down to Bend and see the wonderful McVays! That plural had jsut recently grown with baby Callan, so I got to see the whole family growing and killing it, as they always do. Such great, awesome, and generous people. In case you didn't know the McVay's are absolutely INCREDIBLE cooks. Just downright incredible. They had some pulled pork tacos whipped up with lime pound cake to finish it all off to feed us. Holy shit was it good. They cherry on top? They packed me a bunch of leftovers to take with me. So friendly, so down to earth, so funny, and such great people to see and be with! Also, beer opener on the dog's collar. Ryan, you're a Genius! (And a killer brewer - go check out Three Creeks in Sisters, OR and say hi to Ryan for me!)</p>

    <p>Back to Portland for the weekend, and it was time to take a chill day to see some friends. First up was Friday night, and I headed over to Yann der Mann to see him getting all settled into Portland! He'd recently moved over from Stuttgart, so it was great to see him all snuggled up in his new digs with Klara. We walked around and headed over to Spitz for some delicious grub, and chatted the night away. Great times with a great dude!</p>

    <p>Rather than having to play tour guide (I was able to write-up a long-enough list for my boss and coworker to keep em busy), Saturday continued the friend visits. An early and lazy morning before grabbing some killer Nong's Khao Man Gai and heading out to St. Johns to see Josef. Poor guy was having some massive back problems, but I got to see him and catch up, meet his wife and puppy, and hear all about his new adventure! Glad to see him so positive and having such a great opportunity ahead of him.</p>

    <p>After chatting for a good while in the sunlight, I said adios and headed down to my favorite bridge in town and the wonderful park right below it. While waltzing around on the pier, I was spontaneous chatted to by a guy from New York. He was also astounded by the bridge, and a nice little chat about bridges popped up out of the blue. The friendliness of folks is something I miss that you don't see in Germany.</p>

    <h2 id="Commentary">Let the Commentary Begin...</h2>

    <h3>Cuisine in Germany</h3>

    <p>One fine Sunday afternoon, Franz and Steph with baby Anton were in Karlsruhe visiting family and friends. I ended up pedaling over to the park to see them, then we walked back to my place to sit and warm up for a bit. Well, Franz is an absolute wealth of knowledge, and every time I'm with him I learn something really cool and intriguing about Germany, Europe, or the World. Pretty awesome to have so many friends like that!</p>

    <p>Germany has cultural foods because of guest workers. Italian and turkish - yufka likely invented in Stuttgart from guest workers





    <h3>Working in Germany</h3>

    <p>One night after bouldering with Christoph and Mischa, we pedaled over to Mischa's place for a few beers and to hang out and chat. On the table was a thick book, kinda looked like a dictionary


    <h3>The Constant Coming and Going - Blessing and Curse</h3>

    <p>In a place long enough to feel integrated/welcome/engaged, then I'm gone for a good month or more and feels like a reset. Sometimes my own fault, sometimes work's fault, but the constant refresh of getting integrated and feeling a part of a community is a bummer.</p>

    <h3>Hermit-ness Possible</h3>


    <h3>My Feelings are a Quick Metronome</h3>

    <p>Realizing I sway from one end of the pendulum of my mood/mentality/feelings pretty quickly. Feeling like a hermit, feeling like I'm doing nothing, to feeling like I'm engaged and active, really quick.</p>


    <h3>Reverse Culture Shock</h3>

    <p>Way back in the fabled phase of life with CBYX, when we returned to the US, we learned about an aspect of traveling/living and then returning abroad that is not always directly related to an international experience. reverse culture shock is when, after living away from a while (whether it be international or just in a different area), you return home, and you have to re-adjust to being back home. That can take many forms, but essentially, it's a bit of a state of mind that most people don't associate with international experience. The adjustment to the foreign country/place when you move there, but the weird adjustment moving back isn't at the top of everyone's mind.</p>

    <p>Coming back home, regardless of when, is an absolute pleasure. I love the PNW, Oregon, Washington, and most aspects of the US. But even though it hasn't been so long since the last time I was here, this trip home feels a little different, as I'm feeling some clear aspects of reverse culture shock. Maybe it's not some aspects, maybe it's just one, but that one sticks out pretty clearly.</p>

    <p>When we learned about this thing called reverse culture shock, one aspect that stuck out to me (and a lot of people) was how interactions with people back home once you returned, may not go how you would've expected. Living abroad, going away, you get some pretty incredible, diverse, challenging, and crazy experiences. That is definitely the case for me, regardless of how well I remember them. But coming home, everyone you love, interacted, and dealt with at home way back when, has also been cruising along on their own journey of life. What this kinda leads into, is that you may be back, having had experienced some incredible, challenging, or awesome times, but those things can be covered quickly in a "How was it?", "What was it like?", "Does it feel good to be back?", and then after those questions are quickly answered, life continues on and your recap of life in a foreign world could essentially be complete.</p>

    <p>Writing this in the moment (sitting at Steeplejack Brewery, a new one in my old neighborhood), I've seen a number of awesome people - close friends and great people - so far in the week and a half I've been back. For a good portion of them though, I felt like the interest in what's been going on with me has been pretty muted. Playing my own devil's advocate for a second, I'm not a great conversationalist (I'll touch on that in a sec), and I am really good at downplaying anything about myself. So neither of those help. But on the flip side, questions and interest from friends can be pretty surface-level, and as soon as those boxes are checked, on to what is current, now, and relevant.</p>

    <p>I've had to remind myself that this is the case. A lot has gone on in each and every one of my friends' lives, and since I've been away for now over two years, the amount of overlap and intersection in their lives and mine has slowly dwindled. This is natural with so much distance in between. But that doesn't take away the sadness that is the feeling of losing a bit of touch with some of the people you hold dearest.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, all of the folks I've seen thus far are some amazing, true, deep, loving friends. So I'm chalking this feeling up to self-confidence and unwarranted negative feelings and worries emanating from my weird psyche. As with most things and thoughts in life, that is very likely the true source of this feeling. But, despite that, it makes me sad to know and experience my decision to live and work abroad, has increased the gap between me and some of the people I cherish the most.</p>

    <h3>I'm a Poor Conversationalist</h3>

    <p>Contributing to the feeling of reverse culture shock, I've reinforced my impression and feeling that I'm not good at starting, having, or keeping conversation going. I have always felt that I am really good at listening to people, understanding their words and sentiments and usually prodding the conversation along based off of what they say. I'm pretty proud of that, as I consider myself (in certain situations) a fairly soft-spoken person, and listening is a quality I hold very dear.</p>

    <p>The reason this reinforcement of me as a bad conversationalist has popped up, is I feel like in a lot of reunions with close friends while being back in town, the conversation has been kind of left hanging. We work through a topic, cover something fun, the other person does a majority of the talking and I follow along, and then as soon as that topic reaches its end, there's a lull. Still being a good bit socially awkward, that lull is very visible and tangible to me, and it's a bit weird.</p>

    <p>Being realistic and not socially-awkward - that's not always a bad thing. Conversations ebb and flow as topics change, the vibe adapts, and things move forward. That's normal.


    <h3>German Arrogance or Open Comparison?</h3>

    <p>The main reason I was able to come back to the US for this trip has been the backdrop of a workshop. Along with my, my coworker and boss also joined. This has meant that often the job of babysitter has been forced on to me (which I'm resentful for, because I'm also the babysitter when people come to Germany), and even in situations with the whole group, I've become really annoyed/frustrated with how they're showing their Germanness.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">"We don't have that in Germany"</p>
    <p class="quickhit">"This would never be allowed in Germany"</p>
    <p class="quickhit">"In Germany you could never do that"</p>
    <p class="quickhit">"This is how we do that in Germany"</p>

    <p>Expressions like that are common coming out of their mouths in interactions, and honestly, it pisses me the fuck off. Trying to take a step back, it's possible that these sentiments could come from one of two viewpoints/stances - A) a point of comparison. As in, "oh, this is interesting what I've seen in the US, here's a comparison to how we do it back in Germany." Or B) a pure stance of arrogance. As in "sheesh, this is how it is in the US? Well, Germany is like this."</p>

    <p>For my one colleague, I could see it as a bit of a mix. He's a cool dude, so I'll give him the slight benefit of the doubt. For my boss, I've got a strong feeling it's the latter. It got so bad, that I just grabbed my beer from the hotel lobby with the small group and left, I just couldn't handle the germanness anymore.</p>

    <p>After getting some feedback from my CBYX friends, that helped a good bit. Then I had a call with a German colleauge who's lived here in the US for the last 10ish years, and he pretty much confirmed my understanding. He's had this kind of mentality and interaction with friends who have come over to visit, and hearing his frustration of how present this mentality is, was a bit of a downer to hear. Then, he shared the motto of the state that I live in in Germany - Baden-Württemberg - "Wir können alles außer Hochdeutsch". That means - "We can do everything except speak high-German (the neutral/baseline form of German)". Arrogance to a T.</p>

    <p>The whole exposure to this mindset has me struggling. I've gone through a good bit of cultural training (it was a long time ago though), and feel like I have, or at least had, a fairly open mindset. But having to swallow this mindset has been a struggle.
