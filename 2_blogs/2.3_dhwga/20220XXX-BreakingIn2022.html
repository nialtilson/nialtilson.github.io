    <p>The holiday break with Zack cruising through Portugal as an absolute blast. Back to traveling, back on another adventure with my buddy, it was a total blast. The couple days I had at home after that before work started back up was also relaxing, fun, and nice to slowly gear back up. Unfortunately, since then, it's been a whirlwind of work and chaos. I thought things would've slowed down to start the year off, but that's been way too far from the truth.</p>

    <h2 id="Snow">Snowshowing in the Schwarzwald</h2>

    <p>Before heading back to work for the year, in the couple free days I had at home after the trip, I lined up to go snowshoeing with the gal from the date before the trip. Thankfully, there was a little snow up in the hills (there hasn't been much all this year unfortunately :-( ...), so we packed our things in the car, took the short drive down to a random spot in the Schwarzwald, and got to trekking!</p>

    <p>As this was a bit of a random planning spurt, there wasn't a ton of weight placed on the perfect route or anything like that. But as it turns out, this was the same spot/area that I went for a romp around some snow last year! The conditions were about the same, there was plenty of snow on the ground, and we ended up back-tracking a good bit of the route that I took the year before.</p>

    <p>We first started on a pretty empty trail, and it was quite beautiful. Fresh snow, no people, and just a beautiful walk in the white wonderland. We eventually made it to the tiny little ski hill tucked up in the forest, and romped our way up to the top for a break with a little camp stove action and coffee.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/8BG3d88h.jpg" alt="A White Path"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xaHXnyOh.jpg" alt="Sweet Snowshoe"></img>

    <p>After the break, it was time for some deep trudging. The route we wanted to take was closed off for nature protection, so we blazed our own path through the deep snow and fallen trees. It was adventurous. But after a while of trudging, we were back on the path, and slowly from there worked our way downhill and back out. A great way to enjoy some fresh air before returning to the stifling world of work.</p>

    <h2 id="Food">Adventures in Foodiness</h2>

    <p>Coming into this year, I've been working on getting more proactive when it comes to food. I'm a decent cook, and I enjoy the process as well as the result, but cooking for one can become a chore. Because of that, 90% of the time I chop up some veggies, add in some meat, pick out a sauce, and put it all together either with rice, noodles, potatoes, or lettuce. Basic as shit, but it usually comes out pretty good.</p>

    <h3>Killer Cookies</h3>

    <p>Basic, deadly, and oh so delicious. Found an old cooke recipe in our family's recipe stash, and threw a couple twists in. I made some similar ones last year, and kept that delicious train rolling. Chocolate chunks, dark chocolate M&Ms, chocolate mint granola chunks, and extra leftover from christmas - christmas sprinkles. Needless to say, they turned out great.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/sIPfatuh.jpg" alt="Cookie Madness"></img>

    <p>The reason I made them though was to share with my coworkers. I initially planned to make them as christmas cookies, but by the time I got to them in December all my coworkers were already out. So I made them to start the new year. Well, results were a bit mixed. I slightly overbaked them, so they were a little dry. And to be honest, I think the presence of variety in them might have annoyed their taste buds. Either way, I found them to be delicious, and that's what mattered to me.</p>

    <h3>Crispy Chorizo Gnocchi</h3>

    <p>Slightly cheated on this one, but with the pre-packaged gnocchi, some chorizo, and a few other things to it, holy shit deeeeeelicious. The inspiration for a lot of these came from reddit, and here's <a class="body" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/nbeuno/crispy_chorizo_gnocchi/">the recipe</a> for this one, definitely helps that it's in video form (which adds to the attraction for me).</p>

    <p>I gotta say, damn fine. Some of the comments laid into the recipe for a few too many tastes, but I was fat and sassy with it as is. That little caper/parsley sauce on it though? Hot dayum that was good! The best part was that the leftovers didn't taste like leftovers, but almost got better over time. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend this flavor bomb.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/omty95eh.jpg" alt="Crispy Chorizo Gnocci"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uS32YvAh.jpg" alt="Plated and Delicious"></img>

    <h3>Brussel Sprouts</h3>

    <p>Another dusted off recipe from a Family Christmas years back, it was time for some bacon and brussel sprouts, and also the incredible balsamic glaze that goes with it. Nothing too crazy, but I've never been good at sauces or have much experience with them. This glaze is easy, and absolutely delicious.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/afNLQzIh.jpg" alt="Brussel Sprouts"></img>

    <p>Here's <a class="body" href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a49497/bacon-balsamic-brussels-sprouts-recipe/">this recipe</a>, and again, I highly recommend it!</p>

    <h3>Spinach and Artichoke Mac & Cheese</h3>

    <p>I'd never made homemade Mac & Cheese before in my life. The blue boxes from Kraft aren't the healthiest, but I find them absolutely delicious, and therefore never branched out. Well, Europe lacks those blue boxes, and it was time to venture into this cheesy world. The perfect occasion came too, having Mischa and Christoph over for dinner!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ecj1NRBh.jpg" alt="Homemade Mac"></img>

    <p>Turned out to be delicious. Kinda mixed and matched from a few recipes, but <a class="body" href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a26593313/spinach-artichoke-mac-and-cheese-recipe/">here's the base one</a> I went off of. Shittons of cheese, not quite the stringiness one expects from mac and cheese, but it was yummy.</p>

    <h3>Bruschetta Refresha</h3>

    <p>Not sure why, but one weekend I had a hankering for some mozzarella. Leftover from the gnocchi I had a little basil plant sitting in my window, and new I just needed some tomatoes and I was ready to go. So after cutting it all up, maybe winging it more than an Italian would, I had some honestly pretty damn good bruschetta up and running.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/GRmbgc6h.jpg" alt="Bruschetta"></img>

    <p>Also was on a wine kick, so that always helps :-)</p>

    <h3>Kitchen Sink Frittata</h3>

    <p>Before heading out for a spontaneous week away, I had a bunch of stuff left in the fridge and was hungry. With a ton of extra eggs being part of that group, my mind turned to a frittata! Turns out these are pretty easy to do, but mine turned out kinda ok.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XBy3dvLh.jpg" alt="First Try Frittata"></img>

    <p>In following the recipe, I got all the ingredients cooked up and ready, and then just poured over the eggs before baking. Next time I'm gonna make sure I mix the eggs and ingredients together so it's not just a layer of egg on the top. Still turned out ok, but something to make it better next time.</p>

    <h2 id="GirlProblems">Girl Problems</h2>

    <p>I don't think it's a secret, but I'm pretty single. It's a bit of a sensitive and personal topic for me, but that's where it is. As I said earlier, I went on a couple dates with a gal, and they started off pretty fine. Long story short, after sharing that I eventually want a long-term thing with a family and all that, that apparently was too much for her to handle.</p>

    <p>I had some late night chats with a number of friends to try and help me get my mind around the situation (first the excitement of connecting with someone interesting and compatible, then the frustration/confusion as to why it went south so quickly), and there are a couple things that have come out of that experience. For one, I know what I want, and it's not necessarily a bad thing to share that. Timing, however, is important. I likely was too excited and jumped the gun on a few discussions, but I'm an excitable (and impatient) person. Both need to be tempered to a good degree in certain situations.</p>

    <p>Next, I may know what I want, which is really good for me and all. But other people are on different paths. Unfortunately, with this gal, she doesn't know where she's going. To be honest, glad that red flag came up quick. Nonetheless, bummer to know yet again I'm back at Square 0.</p>

    <p>Short and cryptic, but all that to say, nothing's working out on this front, and I'm trying to come to grips with that. And in the mean time, focus on me, work on who I am, and get my head on straight so I can be sure to love myself before trying to love someone else.</p>

    <h2 id="BikeHD">Back on the Bike - Heidelberg</h2>

    <p>I can never go too long without a little two-wheeled fury, so it was high time for me to be back on my steed and heading downhill. It's still winter over here, but thankfully that doesn't mean that all the trails are closed down, so I headed up to Heidelberg for a day in the woods.</p>

    <p>It was a cold, chilly, misty-sunny day there, and damn it was a lot of fun. The ground was pretty much frozen, and grip was fantastic. Somehow I re-discovered both a really technical trail (yes!!!) and a trail with a couple drops (yes!!!), and it was an absolutely fantastic ride!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cIxzcLnh.jpg" alt="Sunny Snowy Morning"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/H4rVZWth.jpg" alt="Bike Ready"></img>

    <p>In the interest of being social and not being a total hermit, I reached out to my buddy Franz, who moved up to Heidelberg last year. He wasn't able to join on the ride, but after I was done I motored on over to their place and got to meet up with them! After talking with him and his wife Steph (and their new baby Anton!), it'd been over a year and a half since we'd last seen each other. Bummer of a realization, but thankfully it was just like yesterday in seeing them again. Great folks, great friends, and I'm super glad I got to see them after the ride.</p>

    <p>Well that rekindling of contact led to further rekindling and riding, as I got back in contact with Stefan here in Karlsruhe, who's also great friends with Franz! A few weeks later, we were able to meet up, all four of us (Franz's parents were in town and were able to watch over Anton), and head out on a ride! It was another cold day, and this time a little slipperier and wetter than before, but another great ride together.</p>

    <p>Having riding buddies is such a nice bonus. I'd be riding either way, but it's so much fun to have folks to shred, laugh, and ride with! Adding to that sentiment, more to come later :-)</p>

    <h2 id="Bierkistendecken">Bierkistendecken - Project Complete</h2>

    <p>Going all the way back to last summer, I had a conversation with Christoph about a little project he wanted to do. Beer cases here are all a standard size - hard plastic, 20 bottles at 0.5L, and stackable. Well he somehow got the idea to make a topper for them, so you can use the cases as tables/chairs/nightstands/whatever.</p>

    <p>That conversation was all the way back in Summer 2021. And with my slow-ass progress, it took me all the way until Winter 2022 to get them done! But after coming back from Portugal, finally getting over the mental hump and hindrance of staining, I made some progress. After a total of three coats on each one, they were done!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZZYsLNqh.jpg" alt="Singular Topper"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/kColOmnh.jpg" alt="Toppers in a Row - Front"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CTpdmzyh.jpg" alt="Toppers in a Row - Side"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/O3AS8Xhh.jpg" alt="Toppers in Use"></img>

    <p>In total, I made seven of them. One broke while building, so the six that came out in the end turned out pretty good. Some were made with some scrap wood, some from a new board I cut down to size. Two were for Christoph (since it was his idea), two were for me, one for Mischa, and one for a gift that I had to put together (more to come later).</p>

    <p>I love me a good woodworking project. Unfortunately, I'm really slow at them, and the processes of sanding and staining are such annoying mental hurdles for me. But nevertheless, nothing like having a beautiful tangible product at the end!</p>

    <h2 id="Organization">Getting Organized</h2>

    <p>One thing that really wore me out last year was just having so much to do, so much I wanted to get done, and not nearly a semblance of enough time to get it all done. It caused a lot of stress, frustration, and was just mentally draining to have all the things I wanted to get done in my mind (and a lot that I forgot about to boot...), and just not being able to fit them in. All because I was either working too much, focusing on something big, or just lacked the energy or motivation to get started on something even when I had the time to do so.</p>

    <p>Back when I was part of the autonomous project, we tried to implement a bunch of agile methodologies into our work, and one that I really liked was our <a class="body" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards">kanban board</a>. I had my own color, all my tasks were clearly laid out on the board, and I was able to physically move them around depending on what I was working on and what I'd completed.</p>

    <p>Around that time back in Portland, I even went so far as to implement that at home. I had that weird, unusable fireplace thing right in the middle of the living room, and that empty space turned into my kanban board. I had a few different categories of tasks I had in front of me, tracked the priority, and had a done pile for whenever I completed something.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/hwAqWngh.jpg" alt="My kanban board - Context"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iGgNTSRh.jpg" alt="My kanban board"></img><br>

    <p>Well right now, I'm not going in depth on anything or categorizing anything at all, I'm just working on the first step of getting the things I have to do laid out in front of me so I can track them. It's a single color, a jumbled mess of things to do, but I'm just working on making sure I keep track of all the things I have to do, and give myself the minimal reward of moving the post-it to the done pile once it's complete. It's also on my coat jacket closet, so every time I leave the house or come back, it's right in my face.</p>

    <p>Progress. Small progress, but progress nonetheless!</p>

    <h2 id="Photography">Photography Stuff</h2>

    <p>Coming out of the trip to Portugal, and having looked back at all the pictures I took, I was a bit disappointed in the overall quality of them. Yes, there were some good ones, but a lot of pictures that I was really excited about, liked, or were hoping for good results, came out blurry or just not ideal. Being a visual person, that really bummed me out.</p>

    <p>That said, my camera is 9 years old. The last time I took it in for service, the technician guy said at that point a few years ago, that it was an old bird anyways. So, knowing the camera body was likely on its last legs anyways, I splurged and got myself a new camera! My old Canon Rebel T4i is still alive (for now), but now I'm rolling around with a Canon 90D. There's a lot different about it compared to the old T4i, but those'll all just take some time to get used to.</p>

    <p>As soon as I got it, I sat around and played with the controls and settings to try and familiarize myself with it. My living room was my first test subject, and I got in a couple shots just to see how I can dial myself in with the thing.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/aRsEiKgh.jpg" alt="My Feet"></img><br>

    <h3>Night Photography</h3>

    <p>As a first little excursion with the new rig, I decided to take a cold, random Friday, jump on my bike, and head out with my tripod to get in some night photography practice. As I said, it was cold, and at the first stop I realized I forgot the tripod-camera mount (stupid), but I got to work on trying to capture some night scenes.</p>

    <p>It'd been a REALLY long while since I'd used my tripod or tried to do anything like this, and it turns out it's not as easy as I laid it all out in my head. I somehow would always come out with blurry pictures, and I think there were a couple culprits to that. For one, my tripod is light, but can be a tad unstable. Then again, any movement, wind or otherwise, is enough to make a blurry picture when the exposure goes for over half a second.</p>

    <p>Another likely reason, is that I was choosing some difficult scenes. In order to use autofocus, you need high contrast for the focus points to be able to get the right detail on the focus. For a couple of spots I wanted to shoot, there was very little contrast - aka everything was a similar shade of dark - and therefore autofocus had a tough time finding a spot to focus onto.</p>

    <p>All that said, I've still got a lot of room for improvement. Despite the cold night, I had some tunes in my ears and did a little riding around town to a few different spots, and came up with a few ok shots. Take a look!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SsSbzjEh.jpg" alt="KVV Haltestelle"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7ocwwGOh.jpg" alt="Tracks and Roadway"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yCwFLWhh.jpg" alt="The Lonely Trike"></img>

    <p>Not quite as good as my night shots from way back when in Hamburg, but something to keep cranking away at for sure. Looking forward to some warmer weather to make it a little easier to wander around at night!</p>

    <h3>Working on the Craft</h3>

    <p>Not sure how, but I've kinda gotten onto a mini reading kick, which I hope is slowly turning into a habit, since the start of the year. It's waned a bit in recent weeks, but after finishing off the book from José Saramago, I went to my bookshelf to see what I could dive into next. Rather than going the fiction route, I saw a couple photography books that I'd gotten but never read, and popped them out.</p>

    <p>First up is <em>Photography for the Joy of It</em>, and has been a great baseline look into the art of photography. Some concepts are new, some not, but getting a clarification on a lot of things, as well as some depth to the details behind them, has been a nice course.</p>

    <p>I've tried to internalize what I can from the book, and plan on using them next time I'm out traveling or shooting more photos. Here's to some improvement!</p>

    <h2 id="Swing">Getting Back to Swing</h2>

    <p>This whole pandemic bullshit has really had a negative impact on all of our lives, and one aspect for me that has been grinding me has been swing dancing. I haven't danced since I left Portland, which is now over two years ago. That's a crazy long time to not do something that I found so much enjoyment and fun in.</p>

    <p>To try and remedy this (and it's on my kanban board so I can't forget about it), I reached out to the local dance school to see what my options were. Long story short, I need a dance partner before I can dance. Not an easy prospect being still a foreigner and quasi-newbie in this town, but that's the deal.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, the dance school has a little portal to try and connect people looking for dance partners, so on the hunt! Luckily enough, I got in contact with one gal who seemed to be at a similar level. Needless to say, I was pretty excited. After a little back and forth and some contact, I confirmed it on my end that we'd start the coming Sunday, and assumed we were all good to go.</p>

    <p>Well, showing up to the dance school on that Sunday, I got my shoes on, and waited, but no one came. Since a parter is required to dance, I was left high and dry. I waited around a little while, but she never showed. Quite the bummer if you ask me.</p>

    <p>So, despite the impression that I was good to go and dance-ready, starting back (yet again) at Square 0. A common theme in a few aspects of life, but the search continues!</p>

    <h2 id="Sinsheim">The Technik Museum - Sinsheim</h2>

    <p>In the bridge between January and February, we were lucky enough to be able to host one of our testing colleagues from Portland during the integration workshop! Well, as I'd taken a trip out to the Technik Museum in Speyer in September, I didn't want Jon (our colleague) sitting around all weekend, so we planned to head up to the Technik Museum in Sinsheim! It was a short drive up, but we motored over and got to exploring the twin to the one in Speyer.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FhguqFqh.jpg" alt="Concorde and Russian Copy"></img>

    <p>As you'd imagine, it was just as cool and just as crammed with all kinds of stuff to please our engineering eyes and minds. Quite the conglomeration of cars, planes, trains, boats, tanks, and you can guess the rest. We did a lot of walking around, admiring the many unique and incredible pieces of machinery on site.</p>

    <p>Here were some of the highlights and thoughts we had during our romp around the museum:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I have no idea where they collected all these pieces, but there's a shitton of stuff there</li>
      <li>They have one of Lamborghini's old tractors!</li><br>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cCnXOCVh.jpg" alt="Lamborghini Tractor"></img><br>
      <li>They had a ton of tanks on site, but all of them were De-Militarized. What does that mean? Essentially a giant chuck of the armor had to be cut out to designate it as a no-longer functional tank. Pretty cool method.</li><br>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/jgvxu3eh.jpg" alt="Tank Row"></img><br>
      <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q0CBb7oh.jpg" alt="Demilitarisierung"></img><br>
      <li>Jesus Fucking Christ. Who the hell thought it ok to allow fucking swastikas in the museum. There weren't many, but goddamnit..... Get that sign of hatred out of there...</li>
      <li>Communism stands for Copying. I had no idea, but the USSR had created essentially a copy of the Concorde, and the museum had one on display. Cool plane, but seriously, nearly carbon copy...</li><br>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iJ44Tqah.jpg" alt="Concorde and Copy-SSR"></img><br>
      <li>On the tail of the Communist-Concorde-Copy, there were some asymmetric air flow guides, two lower on the left side, two higher on the right side. I've been meaning to look up the point of those, but that seemed a little curious to me as to why the asymmetry. Something to look into...</li><br>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/wGKdRfPh.jpg" alt="USSR From Afar"></img><br>
      <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/QMIqwQ8h.jpg" alt="The Asymmetry"></img><br>
    </ul>

    <p>Another incredible collection of incredible machines. It was a great time walking around, exploring, and chatting with Jon, and great to check out this jam-packed museum!</p>

    <h2 id="SuperBowl">Super Bowl Sunday</h2>

    <p>Anyone who knows me know's I'm a pretty big football fan. The immediately-recognizable Packers beanie is one sign, but Football has been in my blood since forever, and that ain't going away any time soon. Well, my Packers shat the bed in the playoffs, but thankfully the Niners choked too, so it was a Rams-Bengals Super Bowl where I didn't really care who won.</p>

    <p>Going back two years, I was invited to join the fantasy football league of a bunch of dudes I played frisbee with in 2016 and was ecstatic to join! Well in 2020, right before the pandemic came crashing down, we had a Super Bowl party to celebrate! Last year wasn't possible due to Covid, but with things in the slightly uphill trend of getting out of this health catastrophe, it was time to party!</p>

    <p>My team sucked all year. I had decent players, but every week, only one guy decided to play well and the others shat the bed. That took me to the shit bowl (losers playoff), and I somehow squeaked out a win in the semifinals and therefore didn't have to worry about hosting the Super Bowl party! That honer went to Glö, who got pretty unlucky with his team as well.</p>

    <p>But since the Super Bowl starts at midnight here, that means we had a whole day of drinking to help us get prepped for the football fun. Just like two years ago, on the agenda was a little Bosseling. Think of it as rolling a ball down a path from a start point to an end point, and whichever team does it in the fewest throws, wins! Simple and fun enough, we headed out to a forest to get things going.</p>

    <p>All with beers in hands (I love the fact you can drink anywhere in Europe...), we got things rolling! It was a beautiful, sunshiny day, and the company was just as wonderful, and we got to rolling and walking along with some great conversation and good times.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uOKa8S8h.jpg" alt="The Forest"></img>

    <p>After a good few hours, some good and bad throws, and a good few beers, we made a big 'ole loop around the forest and my team won. Woot!!! From there, it was back on the bikes and back to the 'frisbee' garden in the south of the city. There it was a good time to chill, hang out, chat, and for a big crew, to jump in the sauna. Also, look at Tim being a baus with a Weizen Glass on the bike. Love it.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eJjeISBh.jpg" alt="Glass and Bike"></img>

    <p>I hung out for a bit before heading home, heading to the failed swing dance class, and from there it was off to Glö's house for the full night. There, it was time for the full program. Wraps, Snack Stadium, Winners (aka Guzzer), and a good time all around. Guzzer is our commisioner, so it's a little sketchy that he won all the awards, but he had a good team, so I guess it was well earned.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Pv9lhduh.jpg" alt="Snack Stadium"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/j047MDah.jpg" alt="Guzzer Prize Machine"></img>

    <p>With a little Nintendo to get us through the 10pm, 11pm slog, we made it to kickoff around midnight and got to watching the game. In all, kind of a lame game, not just because of the teams, but honestly not all that exciting a game. Also, for some reason Foxi won almost all of the Squares money, seemed somehow rigged.</p>

    <p>After the game, it was quick back home for me, because I had a supplier visit at 9am the next day. Not ideal coming off of 5 hours of sleep, but that's what happens when the Super Bowl happens!</p>

    <h2 id="GoodDay">A Good Day</h2>

    <p>Not sure why or how, but Tuesday, February 15th was a great day for me. I had a great song stuck in my head, work was fine, it was sunny outside, and things were just feeling up. I really don't know where to put my finger down on it, but I really enjoyed the positive wave I was riding all day. I should force a few more of those into my schedule.</p>

    <h2 id="Music">Recent Tunes for your Groove Boxes</h2>

    <p>One contributor to the good mood I had on Feb 15th was a great song stuck in my head. The beat, vibe, mood, and random exclamation of "HORNS!" had me bobbing and weaving to the great tunes all day. In the interest of good music and sharing that kind of love, here are some tunes that have been weaving through my ear canals of late that you may or may not also find a good groove in.</p>

    <p><strong>Broke - Samm Henshaw</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe0Enf31npc">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1JqcZQCnxjDOfZZwQidb1H?si=640e0891b7bb4344">Spotify</a><br>
    Seriously, the "HORNS!" yell after the first bar makes me smile every time. But I love the horns, the groove, and the smooth vocals on this track. Bummer it's not over a bit more of a rosy topic, but love the good waves coming out from Samm Henshaw here.</p>

    <p><strong>Irrational - Shay Lia</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tVq-8jwj90">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/09m6It4feoA7uVhZxWUcbt?si=25349b13544847ce">Spotify</a><br>
    I've got a thing for good female vocals, and a little whispery tinge to it always helps. Another good Spotify recommendation with a good up-tempo beat and some lovely horns to round it all out.</p>

    <p><strong>Kaleidoscope Eyese (Audiotree Live Version) - Liz Cooper and The Stampede</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEV6oLN6gkA">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6ZqYeKK1HrmzmbNc4ywGQq?si=2e2e2292b26e4676">Spotify</a><br>
    Wonderful vocals? Check. Low key mood? Check. Live recording? Check. Great story and flow? Check. Such a relaxing and lovely listen.</p>

    <p><strong>House Call - The Shouting Matches</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM2aI35hLIA">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0rl5DA937m7eHFCMt2Wdxe?si=a2ae9c3fb1b74d63">Spotify</a><br>
    Good driving beats with a bunch of variety on the vocals, and something that goes well with a whispy glass of whiskey. Also a big fan of vocals that show a ton of emotion, and this one rides the emotional rollercoaster for a good bit of it.</p>

    <p><strong>Illusion - Beat Connection</strong> -- <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBKz5Wle_o">Youtube</a>  <a class="body" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/580frkT77JeeXvxAkKLrO0?si=8c6b48e463da4953">Spotify</a><br>
    Found out about Beat Connection through Spotify, but initially through one of their other songs (Hesitation, another great poppy, beat-full jam). Love the good beat, the drive, and the little story in this tune.</p>

    <h2 id="Madonna">New Bike <strike>Day</strike> Month!!!</h2>

    <p>The topic of a new bike has been pretty consistently on my mind way back since my frame broke broke in Scotland. That was a really depressing moment, and although I found myself a quick fix and way to keep riding for the months afterwards, I was really in the market for a new ride.</p>

    <p>The first option was to go through with the crash replacement setup (which is ongoing). Unfortunately, I had to send my broken frame into Transition in order to get that option going. But, on the upside, that means I've got a 30% off offer to a new bike (full build). Pretty slick deal when you add it all up. Although Transition said sometime Q1/Q2 of 2022, I haven't heard a lick of news from them since September/October timeframe. So that waiting game is still ongoing.</p>

    <p>In the mean time, thoughts of a new bike are still rolling around on my mind. And talking bike stuff doesn't really slow down, especially when you hang out and ride with the technical bike-crazy minds of Stefan and Franz. Both of them ride something from a pretty small German bike company, RAAW, and are essentially unpaid ambassadors for them. Franz got one of the first four Madonna V1s ever made by the company, and absolutely raves over it. Stefan has a Madonna V2, rides it like a machine, and it always comes back for more. He even won the first Madonna-of-the-Month awards. Popular dude.</p>

    <p>Way back when, sometime in September, I spur of the moment signed up for the Madonna info of when they'd be back in stock. I almost pulled the trigger and got one back then, but wasn't convinced on jumping from 27.5" wheels all the way up to a full 29" wheel rig. The new Patrol (which I've technically got on order) is a mullet, with 29" wheel front and 27.5" wheel back, so I'm already slated to jump into foreign waters with that.</p>

    <p>Well, sometime around mid-/end-January, I got a message from RAAW saying the Madonnas would soon be back on sale. That coincided with a few times riding with Franz and Stefan, and even getting to ride theirs for a quick taste. Long story short, when the bikes when back on sale at 15:00 on January 27th, I clicked away and snagged my new frame as fast as I could!</p>

    <p>RAAW only sells frames, which I can't blame them with all the delivery delays and such. But what that means, this new bike is going to be built from the ground up, fully customized, and ready to shred. I'll be publishing a new page with all that information and details on my new ride once it's here, built, and ready to go, but HOT FUCKING DAMN I'm totally stoked!!!!!</p>

    <p>It's been a whirlwind of decisions, parts ordering, stocking up, and getting ready to build. I've nearly got everything in place, but the frame is going to be the last thing to arrive. I'm hoping it arrives before I fly out to the US, but it's all a bit of a cat-and-mouse game with delivieries and such. Either way, I'm SO FREAKIN' STOKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <p>More to come on this later :-)</p>

    <h2 id="Finale">Freeridin' Finale</h2>

    <p>After that great day of riding with Stefan, Franz and Steph in Heidelberg, me and Stefan hit the road home and got to chatting. Turns out, as a teacher in Germany, you are employed by the state (both Franz and Stefan compare it to being a soldier), but that also means you get a ton of breaks. A ton. Germany has a bunch of holidays to begin with, but when you throw in school breaks and such, it adds up quick.</p>

    <p>One of those many school breaks was coming up - Winter Break or something, essentially a week off at the end of February/beginning of March. His plan - head down to Finale Ligure in Italy and mountain bike for a full week. As soon as I heard it, I got jealous. Finale Ligure is supposed to be an incredible mountain bike destination, and the chance to enjoy it for a full week sounded incredible!</p>

    <p>He threw out the great idea/offer of me coming down for some/all of it, and I immediately started thinking how I could make that work. I've got a bunch of vacation and over hours to blow off, so I figured I could make a long weekend out of it. Only an 8 hour drive, so why not?</p>

    <p>I reached out to the place Stefan was staying, and they had a 6 night minimum (likely because of the holiday, bummer). I looked around, and a lot of other places were booked out or not quite compatible with the dates I was thinking. Eventually I came to the point and just said fuck it. Why don't I take a full week off? And that's exactly what I did! One Fine Friday I put in a few hours of work and mid-afternoon, Rupert was all packed up and ready to head south. Italian Coast, here we come!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/48GaMGwh.jpg" alt="Rupert, packed and ready "></img>

    <p class="quickhit">That's become a pretty frequent pic of mine lately, and I kinda like it!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vYVFYpUh.jpg" alt="Horns Up on the Road Down"></img>

    <p>Getting down through Germany and parts of Switzerland were quite the breeze. Then traffic hit. First at the 16km long Gotthard tunnel. Not sure why they had stop lights active for a perfectly clear roadway, but that added a ton of time. Then, at the Italian border, entry into Como, was another parking lot. I wasn't feeling sitting in traffic, so found my way around it, and kept motoring on. Eventually, around 23:30, I made it to the hotel, got checked in, and was ready for a week of biking! Woot woot!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/mMQWv9Qh.jpg" alt="Rupert, Safe and Parked"></img>

    <p>That next morning, I was up early, and in a place I hadn't seen by daylight yet. Since we weren't heading to the bike shuttle til 10:30, I was off for a little morning walk in search of breakfast and getting a view of the little town on the coast. It was a fresh morning, but full of sunlight, and the little jaunt around town was beautiful. From the hotel I walked through the little pedestrian zone, made my way out to the water, then enjoyed the warm sunlight for a bit. Then on the way back, I stopped off at a little cafe for a croissant and Americano (they give you the espresso and hot water separately, so you can pour it yourself. Kinda neat!), before heading back to suit up for the daily ride.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iK5IQk6h.jpg" alt="Ligure Ped Zone"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/p3rl4rXh.jpg" alt="Ligure Bay West"></img>

    <p>Once 10:00 rolled around, it was time to roll! Stefan and I met at the bike locker, and we took the quick ride over to Finalborgo to get to the bike shuttle. A little bit of moseying around, and then we got packed into vans and headed up to NATO Base, one of the trailheads at the top of the hills above the coast. It was a good 40min ride from the coast up to the peaks, and with the clear skies and beautiful day ahead of us, once we biked up to the base, you could see for miles. If you squint, you can even see the island of Sicily there in the third pic below!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/oRwD7ZEh.jpg" alt="Stefan, on the way"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/DNnlIZ8h.jpg" alt="Top of NATO Base"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/E63DwR7h.jpg" alt="Sicily in the Distance"></img>

    <p>From the top, we did our (my) first run down Madre Natura, and I was immediately in heaven. Different than what I anticipated or thought I'd be riding, but hot fucking damn, so good. Flowy, loamy, rooty, a bit rocky, and just so damn buttery. We ripped right on down and with a big smile on my face, we turned around and pedaled back up to the top. From there, it was a round of Crestino Pt. 1, Carvarezza, Ingegnere, and Crestino Pt. 2. We even built a little rock bridge through a gully (that someone tore down the next day). Massive grins and energized blood flowing strong after such great trails, we rolled our way down the long road back to Finalborgo.</p>

    <p>Time for lunch, and getting ready for the next shuttle up. Stefan had a pizza place in mind, so we walked our bikes through the small old-town of Finalborgo, and were presented with a line out of Pomo D'Oro, the target shop. Nothing to do but wait until we were called in. And when we were, ohhhh boy what a selection. Definitely not your typical kinda pizza (not sure if it was Focaccia, Pizza, or some other classification), but I loaded up with the spicy sausage (wasn't spicy) and tomato and mozzarella 'slices' and we wandered out to eat them in the sun.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/sFvBep9h.jpg" alt="Pomo D'Oro"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ubdPUbgh.jpg" alt="Pizza Run"></img>

    <p>As we were walking with our bikes and pizza to the nearest bench, Stefan spotted a fellow Karlsruher! Mike was down for the week as well, and as I learned, he's essentially Finale local, coming down 5-7 times a year! We chatted with him once we sat and ate, but soon enough had to wrap up, pack up our last pieces of pizza for trail snacks, and book it back to the shuttle for the next ride up.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/LL9Llfah.jpg" alt="Loading Up"></img>

    <p>After the ride up, this time to the start of Rollercoaster, Stefan and I unloaded and were greeted by another Karlsruhe, Philip, and his buddy Eric! Turns out it was the week for half of Karlsruhe (or in all actuality, Germany) to head down to Finale! We chatted a bit at the top, met each other and got acquanted, then headed out down the trail as a new squad.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Pju1gMoh.jpg" alt="View at the Top of Rollercoaster"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XimQg9Xh.jpg" alt="Windy Mountain Road"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/LepEW9Qh.jpg" alt="Patrol at the Ready"></img>

    <p>What an incredible trail. No massive berms like Whistler, no steep rocky chutes like I'd imagined, but incredlbe natural flow in some great dirt down a great hillside. Just good old fashioned fun mountain biking. We rolled and shredded our way down and I was smiling the whole way. Eventually we got to a great clearing and took in the view as two gibroni's were trying to be insta-famous and annoying as hell. But what an incredible view over Finale Ligure.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/g2shBXQh.jpg" alt="View over Finale"></img>

    <p>Once we blasted through the incredibly aptly named Rollercoaster, we popped out on the road and went on a bit of an adventure, courtesy of the experienced Finale-rider Mike. We found an offshoot and pedaled up, then jumped down the tucked-away Metanodotto. Another fun ride. That popped us out into a secluded valley, and we all pedaled down towards Borgo on the coast. As the day was nearly over, we took the laid-back option and found a cafe overlooking the water. Time to sit back and relax :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bXzsCKlh.jpg" alt="Patrol on the Water"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/HXV3XwNh.jpg" alt="Down the Coast"></img>

    <p>It was a beautiful day out, and although I was staring straight into the sun, the warmth was incredible, sky was blue, and the coffee hit just the right spot. We had a nice time sitting around, chatting, enjoying the day, and reveling on the great trails, all the way up to golden hour. About that time, it got a little cooler, so we paid up and pedaled on back to Finale. Eric and Philip were on a campsite up the hill, so Stefan and I said adios, pedaled on back to our hotel, and took some time to clean up and lay back after a great day of riding.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vFjw2Xkh.jpg" alt="Patrol in Golden Light"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SpPHMFxh.jpg" alt="Sundown Pedal Back"></img>

    <p>Dinner was a bit of a crapshoot, as we didn't have reservations anywhere, things were pretty full (Saturday night), and it was still technically the off-season. We struck out everywhere we popped our heads into, and ended up getting some takeaway pizza from a local joint and headed back to my room to chow down, chat, and revel in the wonderful week off. Pizza with a cheap 2€ bottle of Italian wine, not a bad way to end the night! Then, after we killed our grub, it was time for bed and another great day of riding to get some sleep for!</p>

    <p>The next two days followed a similar recipe - great riding, great food, great people. Seriously, that's such a great recipe for a great day! Sunday we did a single-uplift up to Nato Base and then took the Ingegnere series down to Orco Feglino, where they've got a series of trails that feed down to a similar spot and a pretty 'easy' climb straight back to the top. We got in a lap or two before settling down for a MASSIVE pan of pesto pasta out in the sunlight. We lapped it, the caffeine, and the sunlight up with a nice, long midday break. Hard to be some awesomeness like that.</p>

Italy
- really laid back when it comes to time
- speaking with the hands is a real thing
- oh my god the food. The smaller the restaurant, the better. Five tables max is a sign of a really good spot


    <h2 id="Commentary">Let the Commentary Begin...</h2>

    <h3>Cuisine in Germany</h3>

    <p>One fine Sunday afternoon, Franz and Steph with baby Anton were in Karlsruhe visiting family and friends. I ended up pedaling over to the park to see them, then we walked back to my place to sit and warm up for a bit. Well, Franz is an absolute wealth of knowledge, and every time I'm with him I learn something really cool and intriguing about Germany, Europe, or the World. Pretty awesome to have so many friends like that!</p>

    <p>Germany has cultural foods because of guest workers. Italian and turkish - yufka likely invented in Stuttgart from guest workers





    <h3>Working in Germany</h3>

    <p>One night after bouldering with Christoph and Mischa, we pedaled over to Mischa's place for a few beers and to hang out and chat. On the table was a thick book, kinda looked like a dictionary
