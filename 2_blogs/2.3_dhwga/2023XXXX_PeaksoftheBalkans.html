    <p>While in Birmingham visiting Luke, as they were on and planning out their world adventure, I got invited to join them for a hiking trip down in the Balkans! I already had a pretty full summer lined up, but the chance to go explore some nature in a new part of the world was too good to pass up.</p>

    <p><em>Just a heads up, I actually took notes underway for the first three days, then after that it'll all be shooting from the hip.</em></p>
    
    <h2 id="Day0">Day 0 - STR to Theth</h2>

    <p>After yet another full integration at work (the fourth in a little over a month...), I finally was able to gtfo of there. Although it was a lot of work and stress, it had a benefit. It kept me occupied for the morning before I could break away prior to departure.</p>

    <p>Once I could, it was home to finish packing and in that process I made the spontaneous decision to go only with a carry-on for the flight. Turned out to be an easy drive over to the airport, and after I got there I parked, walked over to the terminal and was officially underway. For some reason though, it didn't feel quite like vacation mode. Even though I'd gotten through security and snagged some dinner and was waiting for a flight, I wasn't mentally checked out yet.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UoW8dNah.jpg" alt="Flight Snacks"></img>

    <p>I was able to read the whole way over to Vienna, and filled the time with my usual walkabout the airport during my layover. First time I was there, and that turned out to be a really nice airport. Large, and as always, it was cool to see all the diverse departure locations. Cool to think about just spontaneously picking one and going to a random place on the globe.</p>

    <p>Soon enough, it was time to board and hit the air. I got lucky with no middle seat and no neighbors, but the legroom was sparse. I tried to sleep as much as I could, but it wasn't all that comfy. But luckily enough, soon we'd landed in Montenegro!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fx3ZHpfh.jpg" alt="Montenegro Here We Go"></img>

    <p>Had an easy time getting through customs and after I got out of the airport, my driver was waiting for me. No joke, that might've been the first time I've exited and airport and had my name on a piece of paper with someone random waiting to pick me up.</p>

    <p>A little background here. Unfortunately, my schedule was a little tighter than my hiking buddies, and Luke, Jelley, and their friend Greer were already in Theth ready to go. Since I got in late at night and they'd booked the whole excursion through a travel company, I'd had a taxi lined up to take me from Podgorica into Albania and into the mountains to Theth.</p>

    <p>Mirtu (I think that was his name), my driver, didn't speak much of English and no German, but he did speak Italian! Hah. I tried to use my Spanish, hoping that would be close enough to give us a chance, but no dice. Turned out to be a quiet drive over to Albania. Quiet going through the border between Montenegro and Albania, and no issues.</p>

    <p>Eventually the route had us turn off of the main road and start to head into the mountains. Awesome! But it was dark so I couldn't see anything. That, and I was dead tired, so I nodded off for a good bit. Unfortunately, I think Mirtu was doing the same... But the windy mountain road slowly took us up and over the saddle and down into Theth valley. Finally got to the guest house at around 02:00.</p>

    <p>Just cause I'd arrived didn't mean I was all squared away though. I was halfway expecting someone to be up but that was quashed quick. Mirtu walked me into the building, and thankfully a door to the main room was open. Even though he started knocking on a bunch of doors, no one woke up or came out.</p>

    <p>He said he was going to call the guesthouse to get someone to come out, but after he walked out to his car to go do that, I never saw him again. Welp, time for detective mode. Found the wifi code and then tried to call Luke, then Jelley, then Greer, all to no answer. Fuck.</p>

    <p>Continuing my search, I scrounged through the room and found the reception books and stuff. Perused through those and found our booking number in one entry and that entry number next to a room in another book. Hoping that was the solution to the mystery, I headed down to that room and knocked, but no one answered.</p>

    <p>I went back to the registration books and everything looked good, but still no dice. I tried calling the guesthouse to see if anyone would pick up, but then at that time Greer called me! I was saved!</p>

    <p>It turns out, as she told me where I needed to go, the guesthouse was a little overbooked for the night. So our crew had been relegated to the guesthouse of the guesthouse, which we though was actually the owners' house. Either way, I got to the room, got my bed, and was out like a light.</p>

    <h2 id="Day1">Day 1 - Theth to Blue Eye to Theth</h2>

    <p>And that next morning, it was up and at 'em to start things off! Beautiful day, and what a great eye-opening to the great nature around us! I didnâ€™t know what we were in for, but the route turned out to be a tourist highlight of the area. But we got up and dove into some breakfast, and were soon enough on our way!</p>

    <p>The way down the valley led us through some pretty scenic areas, and first off over to a big waterfall with a really blue swimming pool. Absolutely beautiful spot, but it was also infested with a bunch of instafuckwits. Luke did a good job mocking them, but it was fake everything with those annoyances hanging around.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/j0iVqpxh.jpg" alt="Our Own Model"></img>

    <p>From there we continued on down the valley and got to a junction at the next town. Although it was around midday, we decided to push off lunch til later and started the climb up to the pool. It got pretty jungly, but slowly we worked our way up to the valley and got to a gorgeous little blue lagoon. We all sat down, but Luke had a hunch there was something further up. Turns out his hunch was very much correct.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CoZLfHRh.jpg" alt="Down to the Pool"></img>

    <p>It was just a little further up, but holy cow what incredibly blue water. Fitting that it's named the Blue Eye. We got up there, and I took the little hiking path to get a birds-eye view from above over the pool, but eventually hiked down and joined the crew at the main pool.</p>

    <p>We hemmed and hawed a little bit, but after watching a few people dive in for a refresher, Luke and I bit the bullet and made the jump. No toes first, it was straight in and HOLY SHIT that water was cold. Right in and right out for me, but damn that felt good afterwards.</p>

    <p>That night, as we'd get used to the whole trip, we got some home-cooking at our lodging. The lady at this place was absolutely amazing, and gave easily one of the best meals of the trip. But some great cooking, some banagrams and catan, and some beautiful views to enjoy the first night capped off a great day.</p>

    <p>With a good night's sleep, we were up and ready to start our trek. The route for the day took us from Theth, up and out of that valley, and down the next one into Valbone.</p>

    <h2 id="GBD">Good, Bad, Different</h2>

    <p>Continuing on with the wonderful tradition I gained through the experiences in my CBYX years, here is another installment of <strong>Good, Bad, Different</strong>! This is the part of the story where I categorize (comically, against the teachings of my exchange program cultural training) all of the things that I noticed and what stood out being in an environment foreign to me. With that, here goes!</p>

    <h3>Good</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Mountains and Nature</li>
      <li>Tons of beehives and honey (see the yogurt, blueberry, honey thing from Day 2. Bwuh, so good)</li>
      <li>Blueberry bushes all over the mountains and on/near the trail</li>
      <li>"Old dudes drinking coffee at the cafÃ©s" culture</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bad</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>No wet/dry separation in bathrooms</li>
      <li>Hazy as all get-out. Not sure why or how, but as soon as the sun's up, it's really hazy</lli>
    </ul>

    <h3>Different</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Lots of Italians and Italian speakers</li>
      <li>Tons of travelers from Italy and Spain (confirmed by a couple from each country on the first day)</li>
      <li>Reminds me a lot of various aspects of the Philippines and Cuba</li>
      <li>Tomatoes, cucumbers, and bread. Present at every meal without fail</li>
      <li>Gravestones are extremely intricate. Laser-engraved pictures, massive, definitely a lot of respect for the deceased</li>
      <li>Tons of car was stations along the highway. One right after the other</li>
    </ul>
