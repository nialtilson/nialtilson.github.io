    <p>While in Birmingham visiting Luke, as they were on and planning out their world adventure, I got invited to join them for a hiking trip down in the Balkans! I already had a pretty full summer lined up, but the chance to go explore some nature in a new part of the world was too good to pass up.</p>

    <p><em>Just a heads up, I actually took notes underway for the first three days, then after that it'll all be shooting from the hip.</em></p>
    
    <h2 id="Day0">Day 0 - STR to Theth</h2>

    <p>After yet another full integration at work (the fourth in a little over a month...), I finally was able to gtfo of there. Although it was a lot of work and stress, it had a benefit. It kept me occupied for the morning before I could break away prior to departure.</p>

    <p>Once I could, it was home to finish packing and in that process I made the spontaneous decision to go only with a carry-on for the flight. Turned out to be an easy drive over to the airport, and after I got there I parked, walked over to the terminal and was officially underway. For some reason though, it didn't feel quite like vacation mode. Even though I'd gotten through security and snagged some dinner and was waiting for a flight, I wasn't mentally checked out yet.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5mkIwdIh.jpg" alt="STR Boarding"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UoW8dNah.jpg" alt="Flight Snacks"></img>

    <p>I was able to read the whole way over to Vienna, and filled the time with my usual walkabout the airport during my layover. First time I was there, and that turned out to be a really nice airport. Large, and as always, it was cool to see all the diverse departure locations. Cool to think about just spontaneously picking one and going to a random place on the globe.</p>

    <p>Soon enough, it was time to board and hit the air. I got lucky with no middle seat and no neighbors, but the legroom was sparse. I tried to sleep as much as I could, but it wasn't all that comfy. But luckily enough, soon we'd landed in Montenegro!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fx3ZHpfh.jpg" alt="Montenegro Here We Go"></img>

    <p>Had an easy time getting through customs and after I got out of the airport, my driver was waiting for me. No joke, that might've been the first time I've exited and airport and had my name on a piece of paper with someone random waiting to pick me up.</p>

    <p>A little background here. Unfortunately, my schedule was a little tighter than my hiking buddies, and Luke, Jelley, and their friend Greer were already in Theth ready to go. Since I got in late at night and they'd booked the whole excursion through a travel company, I'd had a taxi lined up to take me from Podgorica into Albania and into the mountains to Theth.</p>

    <p>Mirtu (I think that was his name), my driver, didn't speak much of English and no German, but he did speak Italian! Hah. I tried to use my Spanish, hoping that would be close enough to give us a chance, but no dice. Turned out to be a quiet drive over to Albania. Quiet going through the border between Montenegro and Albania, and no issues.</p>

    <p>Eventually the route had us turn off of the main road and start to head into the mountains. Awesome! But it was dark so I couldn't see anything. That, and I was dead tired, so I nodded off for a good bit. Unfortunately, I think Mirtu was doing the same... But the windy mountain road slowly took us up and over the saddle and down into Theth valley. Finally got to the guest house at around 02:00.</p>

    <p>Just cause I'd arrived didn't mean I was all squared away though. I was halfway expecting someone to be up but that was quashed quick. Mirtu walked me into the building, and thankfully a door to the main room was open. Even though he started knocking on a bunch of doors, no one woke up or came out.</p>

    <p>He said he was going to call the guesthouse to get someone to come out, but after he walked out to his car to go do that, I never saw him again. Welp, time for detective mode. Found the wifi code and then tried to call Luke, then Jelley, then Greer, all to no answer. Fuck.</p>

    <p>Continuing my search, I scrounged through the room and found the reception books and stuff. Perused through those and found our booking number in one entry and that entry number next to a room in another book. Hoping that was the solution to the mystery, I headed down to that room and knocked, but no one answered.</p>

    <p>I went back to the registration books and everything looked good, but still no dice. I tried calling the guesthouse to see if anyone would pick up, but then at that time Greer called me! I was saved!</p>

    <p>It turns out, as she told me where I needed to go, the guesthouse was a little overbooked for the night. So our crew had been relegated to the guesthouse of the guesthouse, which we though was actually the owners' house. Either way, I got to the room, got my bed, and was out like a light.</p>

    <h2 id="Day1">Day 1 - Theth to Blue Eye to Theth</h2>

    <p>And that next morning, it was up and at 'em to start things off! Beautiful day, and what a great eye-opening to the great nature around us! I didn’t know what we were in for, but the route turned out to be a tourist highlight of the area. But we got up and dove into some breakfast, and were soon enough on our way!</p>

    <p>The way down the valley led us through some pretty scenic areas, and first off over to a big waterfall with a really blue swimming pool. Absolutely beautiful spot, but it was also infested with a bunch of instafuckwits. Luke did a good job mocking them, but it was fake everything with those annoyances hanging around.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/PZuUGZXh.jpg" alt="View from the Hostel"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/tjjXRaTh.jpg" alt="The Gang ready to Wander"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/j0iVqpxh.jpg" alt="Our Own Model"></img>

    <p>From there we continued on down the valley and got to a junction at the next town. Although it was around midday, we decided to push off lunch til later and started the climb up to the pool. It got pretty jungly, but slowly we worked our way up to the valley and got to a gorgeous little blue lagoon. We all sat down, but Luke had a hunch there was something further up. Turns out his hunch was very much correct.</p>
    
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ebolr5Uh.jpg" alt="Valleys and Mountains"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CoZLfHRh.jpg" alt="Down to the Pool"></img>

    <p>It was just a little further up, but holy cow what incredibly blue water. Fitting that it's named the Blue Eye. We got up there, and I took the little hiking path to get a birds-eye view from above over the pool, but eventually hiked down and joined the crew at the main pool.</p>

    <p>We hemmed and hawed a little bit, but after watching a few people dive in for a refresher, Luke and I bit the bullet and made the jump. No toes first, it was straight in and HOLY SHIT that water was cold. Right in and right out for me, but damn that felt good afterwards.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/yNQZfhFh.jpg" alt="The Gang at the Pool"></img>

    <p>Once we got dried off and laced back up, we headed back down that valley to the town junction. Since we skipped lunch earlier, we were all pretty hungry. Now it was time to eat. We picked one of the two restaurants, and ended up being served by one of the least conversational people in existence. It was evident that she was likely the daughter of the owner or purveyor, but somehow was only accepting of dialogue where she was only required to contribute with yes or no answers. Despite that, we got a hodge podge of stuff to split, but had to stay vigilant to keep swatting away the bees and wasps.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/0bgLctIh.jpg" alt="Mountain and a Wall"></img>

    <p>Vittled up we hit the trail back to Theth. It was an enjoyable walk up the valley, and the warmth of the day and the nice sunlight made it all the more enjoyable. Soon enough we'd made it back and I was able to get in a warm shower before heading to the patio to read and enjoy the great view from the courtyard.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/5YItD69h.jpg" alt="Trail between Farms"></img>

    <p>Soon enough, everyone else joined in on the lounging around. To keep things lively, we played some bananagrams (I suck), and then started some Catan before dinner (which I eventually won!).</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q4VOR21h.jpg" alt="I won Catan!!!"></img>

    <p>That night, as we'd get used to the whole trip, we got some home-cooking at our lodging. The lady at this place was absolutely amazing, and gave easily one of the best meals of the trip. Tomatos, cucumbers, lettuce, salad, cheese, Bolek, some sausage, it was all absolutely delicious. That all with some beautiful views to enjoy the first night capped off a great day.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/coKUDNQh.jpg" alt="Our excellent Chef"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7npkyl2h.jpg" alt="Bread for Days"></img>

    <p><em>Running joke with the bread there. At every meal, literally every meal, a big bowl of bread was always served, so Luke made a point to get a picture with every single one.</em></p>
    
    <h2 id="Day2">Day 2 - Theth to Valbona</h2>

    <p>It was an early rise to hit the trail early on our first day of the trek. We got breakfast, finished packing, and then we were off! But first something quick. Since that was such a nice place to stay, I made sure to go say thanks to the wonderful lady running the place. Turns out she's from Spain who got 'caught' there 13 years prior after falling in love with the area. How cool!</p>

    <p>But with that all wrapped off, it was time to hit the trail. The start was a slow stroll through town. Getting our packs adjusted, boots warmed up, and getting ready for the next few days ahead, all before stopping off at the mini mart to grab a few snacks. (Damn lucky we did, because that was the only little mini-store we ran into the whole trek).</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/DvJD1Fqh.jpg" alt="Hat & Bandana, Ready"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/OchIiIuh.jpg" alt="Up Theth Valley"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/khRFehJh.jpg" alt="Snack Shack"></img>

    <p>Stocked up on snacks, rust shaken off the legs and pack, it was just a little bit further through town and then all uphill to start things off. I ended up at the front of the pack pretty quickly and was fairly thankful for that - I was able to plod along at my own pace. Turns out, even though I always feel it, I'm not all that slow despite a big pack.</p>

    <p>I took my first break the majority of the way up the hill, and waited a good while until Greer joined me. I had some snacks, drank some water, but eventually got a little stir crazy and continued on before Luke and Jelley joined up.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Hi3cSP6h.jpg" alt="Trail Fence"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/X0MD3xhh.jpg" alt="Montenegro Matterhorn"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/kbs34kFh.jpg" alt="Pizza Snacks"></img>

    <p>I continued pushing up to the top, and once I got to the saddle I was greeted with a TON of Spaniards. Not sure where that came from. But from the saddle I pushed a little further and made my way up to the peak right nearby. Gorgeous views at the pinnacle of both valleys. The rocks at the top weren't very comfy for lounging, but I bounced around a bit while having my lunch and enjoyed the view.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/q8FzI1Rh.jpg" alt="Saddle Congregators"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MJB8Bq6h.jpg" alt="Me and the New Valley"></img>

    <p>After about an hour the rest of the crew made it to the saddle! I packed my things and headed down to meet them while they were chowing on their lunch and resting. Soon enough we were back up and racing, ready to head down the new valley.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cDeKy3ch.jpg" alt="The Gang at the Saddle"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Oig86jnh.jpg" alt="River Run Trail"></img>

    <p>Starting the descent I stuck with the crew for a while. But eventually I let loose and let gravity get me to my hiking speed down the first steep spot. A few stops along the way to enjoy some shade and the downhill, and soon enough we'd made it down to the valley floor. From there, it was all along the road until we got to the guesthouse for the evening.</p>

    <p>That took a good while, and we got caught in a bit of rain along the way. We held up under some big sturdy trees for a while, but eventually threw on some rain gear and our duck backs to keep plodding along. Soon enough the hard work paid off. The scenery kept reminding me a ton of Eastern Oregon as we kept trekking along the road and eventually made it to the guesthouse. Check-in, beer, ice cream, and a book. A great end to the day's hike.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/FLI0DGYh.jpg" alt="Ice Cream Cone and Beer"></img>

    <p>After a bit of relaxing from the day, I eventually jumped in and got myself a shower. Turns out not all guesthouses provide such a great meal as the first night. But that's how it goes. Dinner was a bit unique, but we all dug in and savored the nutrition provided.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the rest of the crew was pretty pooped after the day. But I was still enjoying a bit of energy after the day, so I headed back out to the patio to read and do a bit of documentation.</p>

    <h3 id="Day2Thoughts">Trail thoughts from Day 2</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>I am not used to hiking with others anymore. I got a good taste of it when I was with Theresa, who’s quite the good hiker. But adjusting to this group was a good bit different.</li>
      <li>I feel like slow hiking does to me what museums do to me. The slower pace does worse on my body than a normal pace. The very gradual knee movement and usage, the more static pressure on my joints. Not sure if I can really explain it, but that's my hunch.</li>
      <li>I'm a big fan of long pauses and breaks while hiking, but even I have a limit of how long or much I like to stop...</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of people who just complain</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of people who go on a big adventure but don't have an open mind for different experiences on said big adventure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Day3">Day 3 - Valbona to Cerem</h2>

    <p>Day 3 was labeled as a bit of an adventure day. The route took us up out of the current valley, down the saddle into another, then dog-leg right down another. But at the top there was a side adventure that led to the highest peak in Montenegro! Knowing me, hell yeah I was gonna jump on that. But now with the added plus that Luke was up for it too! Hot damn.</p>

    <p>The morning was absolutely gorgeous to start. We got all breakfasted and packed and were on the road a bit til we crossed the river and found the trail. The route up from the valley was pretty awesome. Further constant reminders of my beloved PNW.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/aQ2XoZfh.jpg" alt="A Shack in the Valley"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3RdNHUqh.jpg" alt="Luke on the Climb"></img>

    <p>After the initial tree-heavy climb, Luke and I found a great spot to chill out for a bit and enjoy the incredible views overlooking the valley. Not one to shy away from a Photo-Op, Luke got his model moves on again in the picturesqueness all around us.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/EpRjPZyh.jpg" alt="What?"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iMgr10Kh.jpg" alt="Oh Yeah"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/IYladJPh.jpg" alt="Trees"></img>

    <p>We hung out around there for a good bit until Jelley and Greer joined up. After a little break, we all continued on. Going from the massive amounts of trees, the scenery turned really rocky really quick. Not only that, but there were tons of suppressions and bowls going up that turned the valley into a many-tiered slope. That was something really cool. Weirdly enough, also something I'd never really experienced before, which likely added to the coolness.</p>

    <p>After passing one random sheep hut (which Jelley and Greer got roped into some refreshments at) in the middle of one of those suprressions/bowls, we stumbled upon one cave up on the hill above the trail. Naturally, we went and checked it out, and got some mighty cool air blowing out of there. A quick break, and we pushed on to the saddle.</p>

    <h2 id="GBD">Good, Bad, Different</h2>

    <p>Continuing on with the wonderful tradition I gained through the experiences in my CBYX years, here is another installment of <strong>Good, Bad, Different</strong>! This is the part of the story where I categorize (comically, against the teachings of my exchange program cultural training) all of the things that I noticed and what stood out being in an environment foreign to me. With that, here goes!</p>

    <h3>Good</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Mountains and Nature</li>
      <li>Tons of beehives and honey (see the yogurt, blueberry, honey thing from Day 2. Bwuh, so good)</li>
      <li>Blueberry bushes all over the mountains and on/near the trail</li>
      <li>"Old dudes drinking coffee at the cafés" culture</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bad</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>No wet/dry separation in bathrooms</li>
      <li>Hazy as all get-out. Not sure why or how, but as soon as the sun's up, it's really hazy</lli>
    </ul>

    <h3>Different</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Lots of Italians and Italian speakers</li>
      <li>Tons of travelers from Italy and Spain (confirmed by a couple from each country on the first day)</li>
