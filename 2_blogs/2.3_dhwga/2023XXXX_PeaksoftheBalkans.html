    <p>While in Birmingham visiting Luke, as they were on and planning out their world adventure, I got invited to join them for a hiking trip down in the Balkans! I already had a pretty full summer lined up, but the chance to go explore some nature in a new part of the world was too good to pass up.</p>
    
    <h2 id="Day0">Day 0 - STR to Theth</h2>
    
    <p></p>So one fine summer day, I wrapped up at work, drove over to STR for departure, and soon enough I'd landed in Podgorica, Montenegro to get the adventure underway!</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, my schedule was a little tighter than my hiking buddies, and Luke, Jelley, and their friend Greer were already in Theth ready to go. Since I got in late at night, I'd had a taxi lined up to take me from Podgorica into Albania and into the mountains to Theth. The drive was very interesting, and a big bummer to not be able to see the nature. But eventually I got in, and was immediately faced with an issue - no cell service and no one awake to check me in, how the hell do I know where to go? Thankfully I found the wifi code and was able to call one of the crew, and they came up (from a room I never would've found), to show me to my bed. Phew. Got lucky there.</p>

    <h2 id="Day1">Day 1 - Theth to Blue Eye to Theth</h2>

    <p>And that next morning, it was up and at 'em to start things off with a day hike down the valley! Beautiful day, and what a great eye-opening to the great nature around us! The hike for the day took us down the valley from Theth through some cool stuff, then up another valley to this awesome deep-blue water swimming hole. Holy shit that water was cold - absolute shock once we dove in. But the rest of the day was warm and gorgeous, and a great way to get our legs under us for the days to come.</p>

    <p>That night, as we'd get used to the whole trip, we got some home-cooking at our lodging. The lady at this place was absolutely amazing, and gave easily one of the best meals of the trip. But some great cooking, some banagrams and catan, and some beautiful views to enjoy the first night capped off a great day.</p>

    <p>With a good night's sleep, we were up and ready to start our trek. The route for the day took us from Theth, up and out of that valley, and down the next one into Valbone.</p>

    <h2 id="GBD">Good, Bad, Different</h2>

    <p>Continuing on with the wonderful tradition I gained through the experiences in my CBYX years, here is another installment of <strong>Good, Bad, Different</strong>! This is the part of the story where I categorize (comically, against the teachings of my exchange program cultural training) all of the things that I noticed and what stood out being in an environment foreign to me. With that, here goes!</p>

    <h3>Good</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Mountains and Nature</li>
      <li>Tons of beehives and honey (see the yogurt, blueberry, honey thing from Day 2. Bwuh, so good)</li>
      <li>Blueberry bushes all over the mountains and on/near the trail</li>
      <li>"Old dudes drinking coffee at the caf√©s" culture</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bad</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>No wet/dry separation in bathrooms</li>
      <li>Hazy as all get-out. Not sure why or how, but as soon as the sun's up, it's really hazy</lli>
    </ul>

    <h3>Different</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Lots of Italians and Italian speakers</li>
      <li>Tons of travelers from Italy and Spain (confirmed by a couple from each country on the first day)</li>
      <li>Reminds me a lot of various aspects of the Philippines and Cuba</li>
      <li>Tomatoes, cucumbers, and bread. Present at every meal without fail</li>
      <li>Gravestones are extremely intricate. Laser-engraved pictures, massive, definitely a lot of respect for the deceased</li>
      <li>Tons of car was stations along the highway. One right after the other</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's been a good while since the trip, so not really anything fresh in my mind to write here...</p>
