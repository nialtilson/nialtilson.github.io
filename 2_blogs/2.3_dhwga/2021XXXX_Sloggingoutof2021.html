    <p>After the amazing, wonderful, exciting, and incredible adventure that was my three-week roadtrip in Scotland, my mindset was hanging on to that sense of adventure. The previous year, year and a half was such a stifling and hard time. For everyone, everywhere. Then, being able to travel home for the first time in a while for 5 weeks, and then directly head off to a 3 full weeks of adventure through an amazing country, my travel mindset was back in vogue. And goddamn it felt good.</p>

    <p>Upon returning from Scotland, the covid mindset and situation in Germany was still accepting of that mindset to boot. I felt like the world was open, things were within reach, and my mindset was definitely relieved because of that. Not wanting to let that sense of adventure leave, fizzle out, or go away, I tried to take advantage of it as best I could.</p>

    <h2 id="NewSteed">A New Steed</h2>

    <p>As soon as I got back from Scotland, only a couple days after getting everything unpacked and back home, I had the old Patrol on the stand and was ready to tear it down. It was a sad process, seeing my old bike have to go, but as this phoenix burned down, a new one would rise from its ashes.</p>

    <p>To save you if you don't want to read about it, I put the details of the build (and the bike!) <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/3_projects/3.1_bikes/2021_TransitionPatrol.html">over here in the bikes section</a> for those interested. But, I've got me a new bike!!!</p>

    <h2 id="FirstWeek">Some Random Things from the First Weeks Back</h2>

    <p>Unfortunately I couldn't just work on my new bike. But, coming back from vacation, I had a full plate of stuff to do at work. Most of that dealt with the ongoing SW Workshop we had in place, but the fun part of that was a day-drive to get out and test our features. It was a fun little excursion with the team driving around Pfalz Forest and Hills, and although it was work, it was a beautiful day and a beautiful area for a drive! And the best part about it, since I was now the owner of a German CDL, I could now drive as well!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/nOEhdVhh.jpg" alt="Cool Stone Wall"></img>

    <p>One morning, while walking out to my car, something was wrong. After taking a look at the car, I discovered the cover for my driver's-side rearview mirror was gone. I didn't see any shards of anything on the ground, and the rest of the car was in perfect order, but the cover was missing. Not sure how the fuck that happened, or what happened for that matter, but I was a good bit peeved. Thankfully the part was findable online, and I was able to find a piece that matched the current paint job, but what an extreme annoyance...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xFh5LCvh.jpg" alt=""Broken" Mirror"></img>

    <p>Either that Thursday or Friday, I was in the mood for a grill out. Thankfully, thanks to my great friends Jen and Eli, I now had a grill! I'd never used a charcoal grill, but after smoking out the balcony for a hot second, I had the coals rolling and was ready to go.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vakBNWXh.jpg" alt="Smoke Out"></img>

    <p>Regardless of when/how, cooking for one isn't the best. Especially when it comes to something requiring a good bit of work. But, that aside, dayum a fresh grill out tastes delicious. I put together a little steak and some hobo-stew veggies, and feasted. Definitely need to crank that thing out more often!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/gQXQTsBh.jpg" alt="FEAST"></img>

    <p>That first weekend, I was invited over to the Weis household for a good old-fashioned German cook-out! I was 5-10min late from the designated start time, but everyone was already on to the main course and looked like they'd all been there a good few hours. Felt bad, but I rolled in, got squared away with some delicious food, and commenced the grubbing. So delicious.</p>

    <p>Ended up sitting around, hanging out, and chatting with everyone the whole night, and it was a great time. Funny stuff, but Christoph went wayyy too hard on the schnapps, and had a bit of a funny exit. I ended up heading home late after a great time meeting and seeing everyone.</p>

    <p>That next morning, I was invited to go play some football with my frisbee/fantasy football buddies! Hot damn, I was pretty stoked, and even through on my Rodgers jersey ready to go! Well I rolled up and boy did I feel like an idiot. Fußball in German does not mean Football in English, but rather soccer. So we played soccer. I need to learn how to read.</p>

    <p>I wish I would've had some kind of toutelage or experience growing up with soccer. The defensive side I feel like I'm pretty decent at. But offense, trying to be coordinated with my feet and do something beneficial, I felt kinda useless. I got some decent kicks in, but overall had a great time on the warm summer morning with my buddies.</p>

    <p>The rest of that weekend I just cranked on my new bike a ton and napped a ton. Finishing off the weekend was some football viewing with my football crew. Always a great way to wrap up the weekend.</p>

    <p>The second week back I got to get back in touch with Christoph and Mischa, my motley crew. Our first meetup was at Linden's Irish Pub, for none other than a pub quiz! I'm always a fan of games and stuff, and pub quizzes are an extra joy! I'll always remember back to the big win I got with my Oly Crew at UW, a huge roaring success to celebrate graduation! But here, with our three man crew named the Fassbräuse, we ended up snagging third place and a luxurious bottle of champagne! Go us!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/zDqEyl4h.jpg" alt="Quiz Win"></img>

    <p>Sometime during that week, I ended up heading to an audiologist to get my hearing checked out. Not sure when/if I've touched on this, but ever since I had COVID in April, my hearing has been a bit weird. Dependent upon where I'm listening to music (in my car, at home, with my headphones, etc.), songs sound different. Songs I've listened to thousands of times and know exaclty how they sound, don't sound how they should. It's been annoying and freaking me out a good bit.</p>

    <p>Thinking I essentially might've lost recognition of a certain band of frequencies or sounds, I figured it'd be good to get things checked out. I found an audiologist nearby and had an appointment setup. Long story short, my hearing is just fine. After the test, the doc said I'm not lacking recognition of any frequencies, but didn't have any explanation as to my issues. This problem is still ongoing, and honestly it's confusing and annoying the hell out of me...</p>

    <h2 id="Technik">Bike Tour to the Technik Museum</h2>

    <p>With that feeling of adventure and exploration still in my head, the summer weather still providing great temps and vibes throughout the region, and Covid not (yet) rising up to a critical point, I knew I had to take advantage of it. There are a number of places in the Rhein valley I have yet to explore. So one fine Saturday, with teh sun shining and blue skies above, I jumped on my bike and headed north. Easy to do and enjoy with the wonderful bike paths all around here!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ToXlg6Uh.jpg" alt="Gravel Trail"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/2BbXg2Lh.jpg" alt="Paved Trail and Tree"></img>

    <p>The long journey took me pretty far north, almost 30mi along the Rhein river until I reached the town of Speyer. There, I had a wonderful bit of engineering porn to go check out, The Technik Museum!</p>

    <p>I'd heard about this place (and it's sister museum in Sinsheim) for quite a while, but was only now taking teh chance to finally make my way up there. The great weather, the great bike, and a great chance to explore finally had me in gear and up there. And let me tell you, I was in for a treat! Even outside of the place they had a plane or two, and the giant 747 up on stilts was visible from all around.</p>

    <p>The museum is right next to an airfield. Makes sense, because that's a pretty sensible way for planes to get there. But after the long bike ride up, I took my little packed lunch to a grassy knoll overlooking the airstrip and snacked away. Not gonna lie, I make some damn good sammiches, and this one fit that bill well. But, satiated and energized, I headed into the museum!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3QFqvmRh.jpg" alt="Blast Off in Speyer"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BeJzYNQh.jpg" alt="Outside looking In"></img>

    <p>In short, this place was awesome. The main hall was an insane hodge-podge of a huge variety fo vehicles, planes, trains, buggys, and all things moving. Seriously, it was incredible! I took my time winding my way along the aisles, taking in the gigantic Bundesbahn Steam engines (one from Magdeburg!), a few boats and fire trucks, and a bunch of little oddities. Really, what a cool mix!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/RdkaIlIh.jpg" alt="A Little BMW"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">I gotta admit, I was a little weirded out and shocked with how many vehicles and pieces were from the third reich. I don't think I saw any swastikas (as that would've been wayyyy out of place), but it was crazy to see how much was related to WWII and that era.</p>

    <p>From the first big hall, I then walked out to the big courtyard to head into the giant Space Building!!! I love me a little space stuff. Maybe not as much or as in-depth as my buddy Zack, but the machinery required to get out and explore the cosmos, and the stories in doing so, always blow my mind. Well, this visit would do just that!</p>

    <p>I've read up a little bit about the Soviet space program that was underway during the Cold War, and one of the stories within that program was the Buran Shuttle Program. Seemingly a 99% match to the US Shuttle Program's vehicle from the exterior, the USSR was working on the development of a similar reusable orbital vehicle, with a notable jump in capability compared to NASA's product. If you're interested, <a class="body" href="https://buran.tass.com/moment-of-orbiting">here's a pretty sweet site</a> showing some more detailed information on the Buran.</p>

    <p>The final flight-intent Buran shuttles are located in a giant hanger at the Baikonur Cosmodrome (<a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q7ZVXOU3kM">and there've been a few people to sneak in and risk some deep shit with Russian authorities to go check them out!</a>). But as I opened the doors and walked in, I was absolutely floored to see one of the prototype/test shuttles front and center taking up the whole building!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uuIBLRoh.jpg" alt="Buran Prototype"></img><br>

    <p>As you can imagine, I was completely floored. After reading about this program a bit, and seeing some incredible pictures and videos of the remnants of the program online, I had NO IDEA that I'd run into a prototype in real life! I was absolutely jazzed! First things first, I explored all the signs and info on the ground and then walked around the big craft on display. Tons of cool things about the program, including a wind-tunnel prototype, and some other great space stuff to check out.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/frJRjYXh.jpg" alt="Buran Sign"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/05rEqfAh.jpg" alt="Wind Tunnel Prototype"></img>

    <p>From the ground it was time to head up. The staircase at the rear led up to the payload bay, and from there you had a wonderful view into the bay of the beast, as well as a quick look into the cockpit. Seriously, what an incredible piece of machinery! I was totall jazzed with this thing, and savored every bit of being able to check it out.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/DBMARjvh.jpg" alt="Cockpit from Above"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/TYufh1Lh.jpg" alt="Payload Bay"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/Rdl5IOuh.jpg" alt="The Right Flank"></img>

    <p>To go along with the tons of info on the Buran and the Soviet Space Program, there was a huge section dedicated to the feats of the Apollo Program from the US and NASA. DOOOOOOOOOPE. Tons of information, huge images outlining the mission and goals of each of the moon landings, and tons of insight that I got to learn about from each of the mission. I felt like a little kid as I just plopped down on the floor in front of some of the signs to read the incredible feats of a technilogical feat, the likes of which humanity hasn't seen in decades.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/JKHr8sYh.jpg" alt="Apollo Dioramas"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ufiLFjlh.jpg" alt="The Magical Moon"></img>

    <p>There were a few other things in the building, but after taking a look at all the incredible space stuff, I couldn't really take my focus off of them. I went up to the upper floors, got to read about the Space Shuttle Missions (some like 130 of them), then on the other side read about the Soviet Space Missions, but then just kinda walked by all the motorcycles and such (seriously, there's so much stuff at this museum!). Then, before leaving the building, I wound my way up to the roof to get a glimpse of the town of Speyer and a top view of the museum.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yd8p9ICh.jpg" alt="Speyer from Above"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vdZk0vYh.jpg" alt="Buran Again"></img>

    <p>Once I exited the Space Building, I headed over to the cafe. I was a bit hungry and tired and needed a bit of a break. A little coffee and cake, I took a load off in the shade of a wing of the F-4 Blue Angel and enjoyed the siesta.</p>

    <p>Next up, I headed up to the top to climb around the gigantic 747 hanging over the whole museum. Not sure how in the hell they got that thing up there, but what an impressive setup! They had a whole stop-light system of when you could go up but I made my way up to the top, climbed around the insides of the gigantic plane, and then was a little jealous of all the kids that were sliding back down to the courtyard as I rejectedly took the stairs. Oh the life of a kid.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FH4BCFZh.jpg" alt="The Front Gear"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/b6vuhUeh.jpg" alt="Off the Wing"></img>

    <p>Back on the ground, I wandered around the far side of the courtyard, and what a cornucopia of cool machines. A gigantic Antonov cargo plane (double rotors on all of the four engines), a wicked looking MiG helicopter, a cool building with a ton of boat models, a gigantic Coast Guard boat with a little boat on it, and even a crazy U-Boat submarine. Cool stuff.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FAPPBexh.jpg" alt="Antonov 22"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uq1Cqpfh.jpg" alt="Double Rotors"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/N3bRJsOh.jpg" alt="Nested Boats"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">While cruising through the U-Boat, I got a good feel of how prudish the US is. In the toilet of the sub, they'd set up a mannequin with his pants down, toilet paper in his hands, and a playboy magazine on the counter. You can imagine what he was doing. In Germany, it's funny. The guys stuck in a steel tube under the water, he's likely going to relieve himself at some point. In the US, you'd NEVER see something like this. Sex is way to taboo of a topic, and god forbid any child walking through would ever see something this obscene.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/X20QSD2h.jpg" alt="Sub Relief"></img>

    <p>Slowly having covered nearly everything at the gigantic junk drawer of incredible engineering machines. There was still a few things to check out, so I wandered to the last area outside to see the big machines over there. Some tanks, boats, more gigantic steam engines, and lots to see. I love gigantic trains, and the Russian and Chinese locomotives there were impressive.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VMkMct5h.jpg" alt="Russian Star"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/4djWwNeh.jpg" alt="Rails to the Sun"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">The thing I said about swastikas and WWII earlier, I forgot. There were some there...</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/0QAIYKlh.jpg" alt="Rolling Wheels"></img>

    <p>By that time, I was getting tired from my museum-walking-pace. That, and I think I took in all the incredible machines riddled throughout the campus. A little museum'd out, I strolled out of the buildings and out of the foyer, and was back to my bike and ready to ride home.</p>

    <p>The Rheinland-Pfalz side of the Rhein has (surprisingly) better trails for biking and walking. As I set off from Speyer, I meandered my way around the airport, through the industrial area, and was off and running on the wonderful trails. After a half-hour, hour of riding, and with the Rhein off to my side, I pulled off to take a break. There was a nice staircase there that I pulled up to sit at. With a few boats going up and down with their cargo, I took in the wonderful evening on the water.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/LYTcIXjh.jpg" alt="Bike on a Break"></img>

    <p>Back on the trail I was off and running. But, unfortunately, losing some energy. The initial plan was to bike all the way home. But slowly, my mental fortitude and energy were making it look like that wasn't going to happen. I finally decided to change things up, and took an early bridge back over to the other side of the river.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZlhA3X8h.jpg" alt="Trail with the Sun Going Down"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/DWLpl85h.jpg" alt="The Rhein in Afternoon Light"></img>

    <p>Back in Baden-Württemberg, I found some more trails, wandered through a few small towns, and eventually wound up in Hochstetten. The path to the S-Bahn station took me by a big field, and that time of the year, the little town had a little Oktoberfest party going on. I thought about jumping in, but went over and watched the amateur soccer match for a while as the sun was wandering off. But, tired and still far from home, I eventually rode down to the train stop, jumped in the S-Bahn, and caught a ride back home after a wonderful Saturday adventure!</p>

    <h2 id="QuickHits">Some More Quick Hits</h2>

    <p>One day as I was headed to Kaufland after work to pick up some groceries (aka milk and some other things), I got blasted with this incredible sunset. I randomly opted to park in the parking garage (I normally park on the ground lot), but up on the top floor I got a great view on some incredible colors stemming from the sun heading off for the day. I had to stop and take it in, just bummed I didn't have my camera on me!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7JDyJNnh.jpg" alt="Great Sunset"></img>

    <p>I love getting mail. I'm living over here in a (now not-so foreign) country, so far away from all of my friends and family back home in the US. So whenever I get some mail, it's an automatic delight. When I rolled home one day and saw a letter from my buddy Zack, with a great picture of us from the bike trip in Oregon from the summer, that really put me in a great mood. A great picture, great letter, and great remembrance of why he's such a good friend of mine. Miss you Zack (and can't wait to see you in a week!)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/GOisIVbh.jpg" alt="Zack's Letter"></img>

    <p>All those back in the US know 420 - the police call sign for marijuana-related activity. License plates here in Germany always begin with letters, letters related to the Landkreis (County) where the vehicle is registered. Well in Germany, I've come to enjoy reading cars' license plates and seeing what kind of words or fun stuff the license plate reads out to. This one made me laugh, as Gerne means happily, gladly.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/4n1Noh7h.jpg" alt="Gerne 420"></img>

    <p>On one Tuesday night after work I jumped into Rupert and instead of heading home, headed out to Stuttgart for the night. Why? To see Lutz! He was in town during vacation and I  was able to break away and head over to see him. Great to get in touch, catch up face-to-face, and hang out for a couple hours. We had a nice time grabbing some grub, drinking some beers, and chatting before I headed home to grab some sleep before work the next day.</p>

    <h2 id="Workshop">A Work-related Workshop</h2>

    <p>For the first time since the pandemic, my department decided to meet face-to-face and have a workshop. Since we still had covid to deal with, a number of precautions and guidelines were set up, but one find Thursday morning I jumped in the car (ditched the carpool because I had plans for afterwards) and wandered my way over to Schwäbisch Hall.</p>

    <p>Weirdly enough, there were a good number of people in the department that I'd never met before. Getting the chance to have a F2F helped me see just how long that list of people was! It was also to be able to see and catch up with so many other coworkers that I rarely see but interact with frequently. It's a bit weird being in the 'satellite' office in Wörth, although almost the whole department sits in Stuttgart.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fSUyNgZh.jpg" alt="Schwäbisch Hall Waterfront"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/qtsyY5Jh.jpg" alt="Tower on the River"></img>

    <p>Well, the workshop was good, as far as workshops go. The food at the hotel was pretty good (and swanky), and after the first day we all met up at the bar for drinks to wind down. Dinner hit (delicious), and then at night we had a night tour through town booked up. That was pretty fun, but the lady doing our tour was a little difficult to understand, so there was a good bit of information I likely missed. Despite that, I enjoyed the night time stroll, took in the gorgeous little town of Schwäbisch Hall, and tried to understand what I could.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MkW1Lcfh.jpg" alt="Schwäbisch Hall at Night"></img>

    <p>Once the tour was over, it was back to the hotel to drink at the bar. No matter where I am, what I'm doing, or who I'm with, it ALWAYS astounds me at how proficient Germans are at talking and drinking, and those two mix together perfectly and they can do it til the cows come home. I only lasted til a bit before midnight (free drinks were done ~22:30) but some were up til 01:00, 02:00, 03:00. Damn.</p>

    <p>The next day was full of activity, and I ended up presenting for my group on a couple things. And you guessed it, full Nial Style - quick and dirty. That session was running long, and I was the last one to present, so naturally I had to go quick, get all my stuff out, and all auf Deutsch. Despite how much I outwardly let on, I still get pretty nervous in front of people. But I got through this all well and good.</p>

    <p>Day 2 was slowly starting to wind down, and I started to get jumpy. Eventually, our boss gave the ceremonialy goodbye pleasantries, and at last told everyone to get some coffee before heading home. As soon as he said that though, I heard the school bell rang. I said a few quick goodbyes, but as soon as I could I was gone. I bolted to the car and I was off. Why the rush? Mountains. MOUNTAINS. And I was quickly on my way to the Alps!</p>

    <h2 id="Gramais">Backpacking in Gramais</h2>

    <p>Jumping into Rupert I headed straight for a gas station to fill up. Topped off and ready to go, I hit the road. Thankfully, there was essentially no traffic. That helped me motor my way south and get to Austria in pretty good time. Thinking I needed the toll way placard, I stopped off to get it and a couple snacks. But where I was heading was not on any main highways, so I essentially donated a few Euros to Austria's highway maintenance. Hopefully they put it to good use.</p>

    <p>Once within the border, it was a quick drive down to Lechtal, where I headed right and wandered up the valley. Dorf after Dorf came along, and soon enough I got to the turn-off and was flabbergasted by the steep road ready to take me way up into the mountains. But despite the windy road, I weaved my way up and along the hillside to get to the little alpine village of Gramais. Thankfully, unlike Füssen in the spring, I found a 24h parking spot, paid my fee, slapped on my hiking gear, gathered all my stuff, and I was off to the mountains!</p>

    missing family time, great to see them while FaceTiming, but hard to be so far away and not be able to directly interact

    Sucks that I'm not there to help with three moves over the last three months. Missing out on my duties as a brother/son
