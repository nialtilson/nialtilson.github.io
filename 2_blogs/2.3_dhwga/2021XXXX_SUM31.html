    <p>It's like SUM 41 the band. But it's summer, and I'm 31, not 41. Again, a poor play on words and text, but I'm trying here... In a bit of a 180 compared to the Debby-Downer of the last post (which was all written a month or two before I actually got around to finish it up), time to tell you all about what had been going on in life as things started to turn around for the time being.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, since it took me a while to get all emotional and introspective with my last post, I've got a ways to go back and recap. Last we left off, I'd just survived my bout of COVID-19 and was able to return to the real world. Truth be told, I am really lucky with my case of COVID. It only involved fairly minimal symptoms, and I have no lasting effects. I am absolutely an exception to the rule, as everyone reacts and handles it differently. But man I got lucky with how quickly my case came and went.</p>

    <p>From that though, with a new lease on life, here's what I dove into.</p>

    <h2 id="BikeFix">Bike Diseaster turns to Bike Fix</h2>

    <p>Thankfully, the whole trauma of finding a crack in my frame came to a semi-sweet ending. I was able to find a frame with the part I needed and got it shipped to me from Great Britain. The whole frame came in pretty rough shape, but the chainstay was in one piece with no cracks, and was therefore a successful transplant candidate. The rest of the frame was dirty, dented, and overall in poor shape, but thankfully I had what I needed.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0kRTkgSh.jpg" alt="New and Old"></img>

    <p>Part in hand, it was time for surgery. Thankfully, the operation was a complete success. And boy howdy was I relived, as I was (and still am) worried that I might be left out to dry with no bike to ride.</p>

    <p>The reason I am worried is A) because the frame I got was kinda trashed, so I can only imagine how much longer the replacement chainstay may have before it shits the bed, and B) my bike has been thrown through the seven levels of hell and come out swinging every time, but it's only a matter of time until that changes. So although she's back up and running, greased, oiled, and ready to rip, I'm worried how much life she's still got left.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/1GM4KCrh.jpg" alt="Rebuilt!"></img>

    <p>As a quick reunion, I took her out and got muddy at the trails here in Karlsruhe. It was a wet day on the first ride back, but my Patrol loves a little mud. After the relief of knowing and feeling that my bike is still ready to rip, I took her home and gave her a nice bath as a little thank you for all the fun rides, crashes, jumps, berms, and everything.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/E20wZFyh.jpg" alt="Bath Time!"></img>

    <p class="quickhit">As a little aside of how asinine and bullshit Brexit is, here you go. Since the frame I got for replacement parts came from the UK, and the UK is no longer part of the EU, the shipment was counted as an international import. Well fuck Brexit, because the cost of the import was a full 30% of the cost of the damn frame. How fucking bullshit is that?</p>

    <h2 id="MoreBiking">Some More Biking</h2>

    <p>Next up I headed back down to Freiburg to get some riding on their incredible trails. Sucks that the Freiburg trails aren't just out the door from my home, but a quick drive south and a beautiful day to boot, that makes it well worth the trip for some great riding! That and I got to take my new kicks out for a first spin!</p>

    <h2 id="Männertag2021">Männertag - 2021</h2>

    <p>Not to leave my Kona all alone, Christoph and I (unfortunately Mischa wasn't able to join)put in a little tour around Karlsruhe and paired it up with the wonderful holiday of Männertag (Man Day, aka Fathers Day aka Himmelfahrt). True to the meaning of the holiday, we combined bikes and beer and made use of the day off, and used this as a bit of a warmup for things to come!</p>

    <p>The day turned out to be a bit wet, but we made our way over to Durlach as a first stop and popped a couple brews below the tower and watched the weather roll in and out. The Durlach Tower has a really cool perch above the Rhein Valley, so it was cool to monitor the rain clouds and the valley as the day rolled by as the world jumped between rain and sun and clouds and a general lack of sureness.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CpquLNMh.jpg" alt="Christoph lookin good"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/o8EZxFrh.jpg" alt="Another View"></img>

    <p>Still young in the day, we eventually jumped back on our bikes and whizzed down the hill back to Durlach, before hanging a louie and heading south towards Ettlingen. Quite the cool little town, Ettlingen, and Christoph shared with me one if it's most treasured secrets.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/g5ued8sh.jpg" alt="Alb through Ettlingen"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7A2C103h.jpg" alt="What a Bike"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/a5XhJNkh.jpg" alt="More of the Alb"></img>

    <p>We rolled in and parked our bikes near the river, then walked down a tiny alley, to what I'd learn to be probably the best ice cream in the area. Litterally just a hole in the wall in an alley, but their chocolate ice cream might be the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. Paired with strawberry and mango?!? Dayum. That shit is delicious...</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ux5zqbdh.jpg" alt="Best Ice Cream Around"></img>

    <p>We took our time with the deeeeeelicious ice cream and hung out next to the Alb (tiny river through Ettlingen and Karlsruhe) while that sweet sugray goodness tickled our taste buds. Eventually though, it was back on the trail and slowly making our way back to Karlsruhe.</p>

    <p>Not ready to call it a night, we both got showered up from the biking and rain showers, then met at my place for some spaghetti, salad, and Borussia Dortmund Fußball! They had the DFB-Pokal Final against Leipzig, and we got to watch the <a class="body" href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=ALeKk0088AzQsjijgZqelRf6thDCq_T1pw:1627110286191&q=Erling+Haaland&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLVT9c3NEw2q4yvzDE1fMRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uVB18ixi5XMtysnMS1fwSEzMScxLAQB6sRgJXQAAAA">weirdest looking dude alive</a> play, and I think score. They ended up winning quite handedly, and was a pretty good game to watch. Not a bad way to rock out on Man Day.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/f9ufiRqh.jpg" alt="Spaghetti and Fußball"></img>

    <h2 id="Birthday">A Birthday of sorts</h2>

    <p>After spending that weekend with the Hollowells (and kicking their asses in Catan), that next week was a test workshop that we had planned back down in Immendingen. Conveniently enough, that means I had to leave on my Birthday to head to the Bodensee. Normally not exactly a bad sentence, but the weather was shit, and having to leave for work on my birthday turned out to be real shit.</p>

    <p>In Germany, the whole birthday and celebration setup works a little differently. In the US, when you have a birthday, everyone else usually provides the goodies and celebration of sorts. Well, in Germany, that get's flipped on its head. Here, everyone else expects you to provide the goodies and celebration to celebrate your own birthday. In my opinion, that's completely bass ackwards, but even I'm not stubborn enough to try and break that level of cultural norm.</p>

    <p>Forced to play along, I made it work for me. A few days before, I called down to a bakery near the test track and had a couple Schwarzwaldkirschtorten (Black Forest Cherry Cake) ready and waiting for me to pick up. Kinda brought it in to the test building to little excitement. But fuck it, my birthday, my cake, I was gonna enjoy it. And boy howdy did I. I think in the three days I was there, the cake lasted throughout, and I had at least one, if not two pieces, per day. That shit was deeeeeelicious.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/6Vv7xh5h.jpg" alt="Schwarzwaldkirschtorten"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/U1SOJ7Xh.jpg" alt="Trucks and Clouds"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5iJ3Gmmh.jpg" alt="More Cake"></img>

    <p>That night we boogied on down to Radolfzell (the old stomping grounds of Sam and Chelsea and a small crew from our CBYX Year!) for the night. Well, as soon as we left the test track I got a surprise call from Christoph and Mischa! Turns out, I knew it was a bad thing to be gone on my birthday. As they called, they were at my doorstep with a case of beer and a little extra surprise to celebrate my birthday. Goddamn work and everything. I was unbelievably bummed that I missed out on such an awesome idea and gesture from him and Misca!!!</p>

    <p>Seriously, I was (and still am) salty and super bummed that I missed out on a good night with two great friends. But, although I was severly disappointed, I was out of town. Damn.</p>

    <p>We got into town and checked into the hotel, and because COVID was still present, things were a good bit weird. All the restaurants required tests to get in, and since tests were in high demand at that point, no one had one. Since I was recovered from it I could've gotten in, but my colleagues would've been high and dry.</p>

    <p>Because of the weird setup, and being around a good size group of coworkers, it was kind of a mess. Eventually we meandered to the main part of town to get some food to-go, and then took it down to the water. Good food, but since there weren't any park tables, I used my lap as a table and ended up getting take-oil stained on my jeans. Eventually got it out later, but that kinda soured my mood a little more.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, the view was wonderful, and I can see why Sam and Chelsea must've enjoyed their time there. A little water, some hills and mountains nearby, it's quite the beautiful corner of Germany down there.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vz3sP5Hh.jpg" alt="Water View"></img>

    <p>But, all that summed up, I'm officially 31. Not the birthday plan I would've chosen, but kinda had to go with it because of work. But yeah, another year in the books, and time ain't slowing down any time soon. Kinda crazy to think how quickly life has been blowing by, even amidst this frustrating pandemic.</p>

    <h2 id="Backpacking">FINALLY Back to Backpacking</h2>

    <p>Nature has ben one thing that's been missing (at least to the degree I'm used to) in my life the last year and a half. Living further away from mountains is, honestly, really hard. That's where I'm at though, and that's been contributing to the difficulty of being over here amidst COVID.</p>

    <p>In the interest of scratching that itch, breathing that air, and celebrating my birthday all in one fell swoop, it was time to change that! And in order to do so, I packed up the car, hit the road, and pointed Rupert straight in the direction of the Alps (on the German side, as border crossing was still not a given).</p>

    <p>After looking at maps and seeing where I could possibly be able to get away from infrastructure and people and buildings in nature, and get away with illegally wild-camping, I set my sights on Füssen, the home of Schloss Neuschwanstein. In hindsight, that was kinda a dumb idea, as it was busy as all get-out, and required me to audible in terms of parking, but that was my goal. A slight motivation to this was the thought of trying to find my name carved into a tree from way back in 2012...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/TR02eLmh.jpg" alt="NT'12"></img>

    <p>Well, the parking lots at the foot of Neuschwanstein weren't full, but they were time limited. No overnight parking. Sheeeeeet. That threw quite the wrench into plans. And as it turned out, all parking lots in the area were that way. That wasn't going to help my plans.</p>

    <p>I ended up driving to a nearby spot that supposedly had a hiking trailhead and (fingers crossed) a standard parking lot. Got there, nope. Same thing - cars had to be out of there by 23:00. What the hell was I going to do?</p>

    <p>As I was putting my boots on and getting ready to just risk it, there was a dude working on some kinda project in a barn/building right next to the parking lot. Exploring my options, I went over and talked to him to get his confirmation that there's no overnight parking. Confirmed. But that didn't end the conversation. He was working on a private property that belonged to some kind of health retreat right next to the place. Private property was not governed by the no overnight parking thing.</p>

    <p>I asked Mr. Josef, and he was slightly hesitant, as he wasn't the proprietor, but he gave me the ok to park on their lot. There were a couple cars already there, so I could fit in a bit, but he said if anyone ask, just say Josef gave me the ok.</p>

    <p>Hot damn!!! I was in business! Wasn't expecting parking to be a potential roadblock to even getting overnight in the mountains, but thankfully a soltion found its way into the picture! So I threw my boots on, got my pack strapped on, and I was off!</p>

    <p>Well, kinda. I got about a half mile up the trail then remembered I had a sandwich sitting in the front seat. Not wanting the smell of rotten cheese and meat to ruminate overnight, I started once again at Rupert, now with sandwich in tow, and I was off!</p>

    <p>Up up and up, just how it's (kinda) supposed to be. Slowly started getting myself up the hill and got some sights of the valley below leading up to these grand Alps. Not just views of the valley, but views of the mountains to the side as well. Quite the beautiful spot.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xCTbVMgh.jpg" alt="Colors on teh Plain"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/TobvSGAh.jpg" alt="Building at the Near-Peak"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MkvuWk3h.jpg" alt="Mountains above the Dorf"></img>

    <p>The majority of the way up at the start was pretty heavily tree-d outside of a few view spots, so I just did my usual thing of put my head down, stick it in a low gear, and start chugging along. Before I knew it, I'd made it up to the first hut and there was a bit of activity with the sunlight and good weather. Can't blame anyone for that!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3PMLKT1h.jpg" alt="Forest Road"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/wRwEyEoh.jpg" alt="The Hut"></img>

    <p>Just after the hut, things kinda cleared up a bit. Mostly because the trail followed up what I assume to be a ski run. Not bad, as the sunlight and bright blue sky felt great! I slowly made my way up to the bowl at the foot of the peak. Cool spot. But from there it got a slight bit dicey, as the remaining stretch was mostly snow and slush and a bit of ice. Steep and sketchy, but me and my trusty boots made it up all in one piece.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Mog8cZ7h.jpg" alt="Ski Hill Up"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Fep2RMrh.jpg" alt="Quad headed down"></img>

    <p>The quasi-peak after the stretch of snow and stuff was the top station of the gondola that comes up from the valley. There were a few groups of folks lounging around in the sun on the patio enjoying the new-found ability to enjoy beer gardens and such, but in the interest of more nature, I kept chugging along and took the offshoot to head up to the peak.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Di7oyWgh.jpg" alt="Big Rock Mountian"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/olkWLrEh.jpg" alt="A Sign!"></img>

    <p>The top part of the peak climb was filled with a bit of snow, but there was a lot of fun rocky scrambling to get to the tip top. I love a little interactive hiking! Nothing too crazy, and soon enough I was at the top of Branderschrofen to enjoy the views in all directions! Sitting around, it was a real breath of fresh air to be immersed in some mountains once again! And don't worry, someone got a picture of me while I was there. :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/jwOvbV0h.jpg" alt="Me saying Hi!"></img>

    <p>I kept hanging out at the top to take it all in. Slowly more clouds rolled in, but the beauty remained, and I was doing my best to soak it all in.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lwaaMFyh.jpg" alt="Cool Peaks and Ridges"></img><br>

    <p>Once I filled up my tank at the peak, time to continue motoring along. Back down the rocky scramble and to the hut, from the junction I took a left to wander into the mountains. Now to highlight a cherry-picked difference in the nature as referenced <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20210716_BratsundSenf.html#Backpacking">here</a>, there was a sign at the junction warning people that the trail became an Alpine Hiking Trail. Now after having hiked that trail, it was essentially analogous to anything I'd've found on Mt. Hood. But, since this type of nature is so rare in Germany (my personal opinion), and due to a number of other things, this what I would consider 'normal' mountain hiking trail had to be noted and warned that it could be dangerous. Stupidly I didn't take a picture of it, but you'll have to take my word for it.</p>

    <p>But, now entering the alpine hiking section, let the fun begin! The trail started out a little flat until it got kinda behind the first main ridge and opened up more into the core of the Alps. As you'd imagine, great views the whole way through!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hmPwwlIh.jpg" alt="A Rock and a Peak"></img>

    <p>As I was winding my way down a bit of a hill, I looked up and spotted some new friends! Not sure how they didn't just all jump as soon as they heard me, but there was a whole group of ibex just hanging out, eating, and meandering through their stomping grounds. I did my best to be quiet but move a little closer, and got to enjoy some Neature. At some point they got skiddish and headed up the hill as I headed down.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3IA9gPBh.jpg" alt="Color Shot"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/GZqMFxFh.jpg" alt="The Gang Up Top"></img>

    <p>I kept on grooving, but the weather decided to stop the good music. Slowly a bit of rain came, and it built to a good-sized drizzle. Not that I wasn't prepared for it, but I just wasn't all about it. That, and it was starting to get later in the evening, I was hungry, and had to still kill some time before it got more dark before I could set up my tent. Definitely a weird way to have to go about it.</p>

    <p>Discovered there was a shed nearby, so I headed that way. Downside was, it looks to have collapsed a good 10 years ago and the remains were just left there. But thankfully there was still a semblance of a bench under the small amount of roof that was still standing, so I parked my butt down, got the cooker out, and made dinner while trying to stay warm with a bit of rain coming down. Dreary, but honestly, nice to be in nature.</p>

    <p>Sitting around, as you could imagine, got me a bit chilly, even after the warmth of the food pouch sitting in my jacket. But I wrapped up
