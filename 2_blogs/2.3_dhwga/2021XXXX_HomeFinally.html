    <p>After the incredible week of mountain biking in Châtel, I had to hit the ground running and never had the chance to stop and breathe before my path finally pointed me in the direction I've been longing for - Home. Before we get to the good 'ole USofA, I had a couple weeks of hecticness at work to make sure I focused and couldn't look too far ahead of what was to come.</p>

    <a class="body_ctr" href="https://www.polarsteps.com/NialTilson/4136754-home-finally?s=A219DDBA-0544-4AAC-8479-011FDC13E124">Spark Notes - My Polarsteps Journey</a>

    <h2 id="TwoWeeks1">Two Weeks to go...</h2>

    <h3>Week 1</h3>

    <p>What did I walk into when I got back from France? Pure and utter chaos. All thanks to the terrible delivery from our supplier the day before I took off, and the fact that it seems like nothing happened the week I was gone, Monday through Friday of the first week was pure chaos. Whereas we normally receive software drops once every three months or so, we got six SW drops over four days that week. The icing on the cake, the SW we got on Friday was the right one, but they had to re-compile it for it to be official. So what's that mean? We got the actual final SW on Monday of the second week. JeebusHChrist.</p>

    <p>All that meant long days each day of the week. Testing the new SW, finding the issues, reporting them back, and seeing if the supplier was going to do anything about it. That, all paired with trying to maintain a bit of a life outside of it, I was not home very much. When I was, it was either eating or sleeping, and for some reason for both weeks, I wasn't sleeping well at all. That just added to the stress.</p>

    <p>The weekend between work weeks ended up being really nice. Friday night I tore apart my bikes in order to prep the forks, shocks, and droppers for delivery. I decided to send them off to a workshop while I'm gone to get them rebuilt and service. If I won't be riding my bikes, might as well use the time efficiently, right?!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/smgnxrih.jpg" alt="Tranny Taken Apart"></img>

    <p>Saturday morning was delightful, as Christoph came over for some scrambled eggs and english muffins. A delicious, relaxing, and wonderful breakfast to start the weekend, and then we chatted about my next project that he supplied the idea for. More on that to come once it gets underway!</p>

    <p>Post breakfast, it was nap time. And holy shit I needed it. I passed out hard as soon as I hit the red chair. Conveniently enough, I was out for a good two hours and woke up with just enough time to get out the door. First stop was Tübingen to drop off my bike parts. Got that squared away, and next stop was over to the Hollowells!</p>

    <p>This was a bit of a bittersweet stop, as they only had 20 days left in Germany before their move back to Detroit. So this was the last time I'd be able to come over and hang out and crash with them. But we made it more than fun! Steaks, grilled octopus, indoor racquetball, Catan, another wonderful weekend with my wonderful family. Sad to see they're moving back home, but happy to hear about the great opportunities they'll all be getting into once they're back!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iS0S2fBh.jpg" alt="Quite the Sport"></img>

    <p>A laid back morning again hanging out, chowing down, and relaxing with the gang was really nice to wake up to. After relaxing on the balcony for a bit, they squared me away with a ton of moving-away goodies, and I jumped from them to go see my good buddy Yann. Sad to realize that we hadn't seen each other since Slovakia the past year, but we met up and went for a nice little walk around his part of town.</p>

    <h3 id="TwoWeeks2">Week 2</h3>

    <p>The second week ended up being more stressful. Work kinda teetered off a bit, but there was still a ton to do. Due to the delay in a functional software, what I was supposed to be doing over the past three weeks, I had to cram as much of it into the week before departure as I could. To add to that stress, emotions slowly built up throughout the week coming from a number of corners of my mind. All that coupled with the lack of sleep really just wore me down.</p>

    <p>I don't know how, but Tuesday night I got my cry in. Or at least part of one. Wasn't sure how it came to be, but cruising reddit I just got heady, and started bawling. Thinking about a lot of things and it all just came to a T. I had been feeling it coming on for a good while, but despite the need, a few days later everything was kinda back to where it was - emotions high and refilling the dam of tears.</p>

    <p>Friday eventually rolled around, and I was done. Donezo. Finished. Useless. COVID test in the morning followed by PT, then off to work. I don't know if I really got anything useful done, but I was there, and struggled through the day. Finally being able to leave and start trip prep, I was just drained. Made it home, haircut, laundry, and time to pack.</p>

    <h2 id="Home">Finally Headed Home - The Journey Begins</h2>

    <p>It was one helluvan early Saturday morning, but my flight at 06:00 meant an early up and out. Thankfully, I had everything well enough squared away the night before to where I just needed to shower, grab my stuff, and hit the road.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/0Mjds2Bh.jpg" alt="Excited and Ready!"></img>

    <p>For getting to and from the airport, I had a different setup for parking. All the lots at the airport were either full or godawfully expensive, so I signed up to drop my car off at the terminal, someone/company would take it to a parking lot, then when I return, I'd give them a call and they'd deliver Rupert back to me. At least that is/was the plan</p>

    <p>Well, it was a weird wait for the guy to come get my car once I got to the terminal, and it kinda got me worried. But after realising it was a misunderstanding on my end and Rupert was in (hopefully) good hands. From there I walked into the terminal an DAYUM having priority status is nice. It was a super short line at the counter and I got my bags, tickets, and COVID paperwork all squared away. Soon enough I was through security and into the airport - the first time since moving over here.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZZvFwuxh.jpg" alt="Short Priority Line!"></img>

    <p>On the one hand, the whole experience was super weird. The first time flying in over a year and a half, and first time in the pandemic and everything. Much stricter rules and a few more hoops to jump through.</p>

    <p>But on the other hand, it all kinda felt both the same, and as if it hasn't been nearly a year and a half since the last time I flew. Tons of people, it's all chaotic, but despite it all people somehow make it to their flights without killing each other. Kinda weird to see so many damn people too, just nuts.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, getting up and out of Stuttgart was quite the breeze. I didn't have to wait too long for our flight to take off, and getting into Amsterdam was gorgeous, with a beautiful sunrise at takeoff, and sun glinting off the harbor in Amsterdam as we came into town.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/RH3LvkVh.jpg" alt="Sunrise leaving STR"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QUZMWhPh.jpg" alt="Sunrays arriving at AMS"></img>

    <p>As soon as I got out of Germany though, a notable difference. Hearing English everywhere again threw me off immediately. So weird to be able to hear every conversation around and not be able to tune it out. That's one of the benefits of living in a foreign country where the local language is not your first language.</p>

    <p>Through screening and into the lounge for some grub and some time to sit around. Overall almost four hour layover, but once I got to a seat in the lounge and had some food, I only about two hours to hang out before heading to the gate. Enough time to relax, do some writing, and take a breather.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">DISCLAIMER:  everything above this was written close to the the time it happened. Everything afterwards, however, was not, and is being written at least a month or two after the fact. I stupidly didn't take notes during the trip, so it's all a good bit doing my best to remember what I can.</p>

    <p>After a bit of lounging around, I decided to head to the gate a little early for a little more walking before jumping into another aluminum tube. The excitement was slowly building, as I was one step closer to being back home. Boarding went well enough and we were up in the air in no time. I was pretty pumped for the start of the flight, but some cloud cover prevented me from doing some high-up scouting of my next trip. The map on the display-thing was kinda sweet though.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/S1QM4y0h.jpg" alt="Scotland from Above"></img>

    <p>After a long-ish flight, I was back in the US. Not quite home, but at least on home-soil. Landing in Seattle, went through customs (which was a BREEZE. I still can't get enough of Global Entry), and it was weird to have SeaTac as my first entry point. But I was officially welcomed back into the US, and then was waiting for my puddle jumper to head back to PDX.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/i3a7ugqh.jpg" alt="Welcome to the USA"></img><br>

    <p>Landing in PDX was quite the relief and surprise. Relief, finally out of the airplanes and airports and could take my mask off. And who do I take my mask off to? Nearly the whole family waiting on the bridge for me. You know it - the waterworks couldn't hold back any longer. A nice big long hug with Mommy made me know I was finally back home. :-)</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/CnyU3rLh.jpg" alt="Me and Mommy"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eLhhmU9h.jpg" alt="The Welcoming Crew"></img>

    <p>Mommy, Alicia and the kids, and Peewee, who drove down from Richland just to welcome me back, were all there to welcome me back home to the USofA for the first time in a year and a half. What a great way to start things!!! I had my bags, we loaded up, and headed back to the hotel near the airport to hang out together.</p>

    <p>Some happy hour, some chips and salsa, and some relaxed time to see each other and catch up. I was pretty tired, but it was so great to see the family. Jerffrey and Harmony were full of energy, and it was great to see them, Alicia, Peewee, and Mommy again.</p>

    <p>While I was in Amsterdam, I was stopped off at a gift shop and got a shirt each for Jeffrey and Harmony. So while we were hanging out, I ran down to the car to get them from my suitcases. First I gave Jeffrey his, and he was pretty excited. Then I showed Harmony hers, and I will never forget the unbridled excitement that she let rip after she saw the shirt. It was so funny and so pure! I asked her if she wanted me to put it on her, and the only thing she could say was "yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah" with a gigantic smile. I'll never for get that!</p>

    <p>Well after some hanging out, the kids were gearing for the pool, so Mommy and Alicia joined them, and I ended up passing out on the couch for a while. I was out cold, and quick. But soon enough the gang was back and we had a little more time to hang out, watch some planes land at PDX, and just take it easy. But, soon enough my eyes were dropping, and I headed downtown to my hotel to get some sleep.</p>

    <p>Once I got to my hotel though, got checked in and squared away, but somehow got a bit of a second wind. So instead of just sitting there waiting to fall asleep, I walked the few blocks down to the Willamette, got called a jackass probably three times in the six blocks there, and found a bench to take in my (former, but kinda current) city. A beautiful night to do so.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Db2Y4PKh.jpg" alt="The River S"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/irTw3s9h.jpg" alt="The River N"></img>

    <p>Eventually though, it was off to the room, and off to a poor night's sleep. Thanks jet lag.</p>

    <h2 id="Start">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>After the restless nights' sleep, I was up and moving to head back to the family for a little more time to hang out and catch up. On the way though, I had to start my reunion tour of some Portland staples. First stop - See-Sees Coffee for a little java. I rolled up right as they opened, and the guy opening was running a little late. So I grabbed a couple chairs to throw on teh sidewalk. Well, a little helping hand goes a long way towards a free cup of coffee! With my java, I jumped by Henry Higgin's Bagels for some sammiches, then was back at the hotel with the family.</p>

    <p>Some great noms, some great people, some planes coming in to land, all makes a relaxed way to start the day with the family.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/nEmG0UIh.jpg" alt="Plane Spotting"></img>

    <p>Around mid-morning though it was time to split. Peewee had a long drive back to Richland, Alicia, Mommy, and the kids were gonna go bike the Trillium Bridge, and I was off to go get some sweat out of me through the thing that's consumed my life (in a good way). We got in another picture, bid adieu, and we were off to re-meet in a couple weeks time.</p>

    <p>From there, I was off to the House of Duvall to meet up with my best bud Andy! One of the biggest things that's missing in my life in Germany is my mountain biking buddies. So as you could imagine, it was such a great sight to see that bundle of energy. Got there, had some McDonald's ready for our/my pre-MTB breakfast, got the bikes loaded up, and we were off to go shredy!</p>

    <p>The cra ride was nothing but catching up and hearing how life's been treating him and Megan and getting back in the swing of being home. Soon enough, we'd made it to Rocky Point and a few other bear hugs for Colin, Clayton, and Lindsey were waiting! Bikes repacked and we were headed up the hill. Gah, finally having my freeeends back in my life - such a great relief!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/v3xuZTXh.jpg" alt="Andy Preppin"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/dKRvliNh.jpg" alt="Smiles All Around!"></img>

    <p>Well, it was hot as shit out, but damn what a treat to be back home in the beautiful PNW. It was a clear day, and on our sweaty tour of Rocky Point we crossed a couple spots with wide-open views of the area, and I couldn't not stop, take a few deep breaths, and realize how much I miss the PNW nature. Mt. Hood, Portland, greenery, blue skies, all just absoultely breathtaking.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ngwQ3Wvh.jpg" alt="Mt. Hood. A Beaut"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/6U4xlQth.jpg" alt="The Gang Ready to Go"></img>

    <p>Another day in the PNW, another day with great friends, and another great day of riding in the books. It was hot, sweaty, but a damn good ball of fun with some great people on great bikes riding some great trails.</p>

    <p>Me and Andy loaded back up and then headed back to his place, and I was invited to stay, hang out, and grub up with Andy, Megan, and Obi the pup! What a treat! It was the perfect way to catch up with Megan and Andy, and pet their new dog, enjoy some DEEEELICIOUS food (they'd been really honing their culinary skills through COVID - steaks, elotes, and amazing everything!), and just enjoy a wonderful evening with some absoultely great people.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cgNxZRxh.jpg" alt="Andy Doing Andy Things"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/brMJAAIh.jpg" alt="Key to Elotes"></img>

    <p>Seriously, they know how to make some delicious food. So we chowed down hard, had some drinks, and I learned a new board game. But, unfortunately, tiredness eventually caught back up to me. It was an absolute delight to see and catch up with Andy and Megan. Such great people.</p>

    <p>From there, it was back to the hotel to hope I could get some sleep. Surprise, jet lag.</p>

    <h2 id="WorkWeek1">Week 1 - Work</h2>

    <p>As I'm good at doing, there was no time to waste being back in town, and two days after I'd landed it was back to Swan Island and back to work. Not fun, but it's one of the reasons I was able to have such a long trip. So up and at 'em, back to Corp III I go!</p>

    <p>Overall, work was fine. It's work, so what can I say. But being back in Portland and being able to jump back into my old team, which is the team I interact with the most from my role in Germany, was pretty nice. Great to see how they're working, what they're succeeding in, but difficult to see and verify the many differences between Germany and Portland, especially trying to figure out how to communicate those differences so the folks in Germany will realize/internalize them. Either way, work stuff went well.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/WHE5RHRh.jpg" alt="DTNA Lobby"></img>

    <p>Monday started things off pretty quick, with some good work and getting to see a bunch of former colleagues. Then, in one of the truest differences between US and German work culture, right after work I headed up to the local dive bar for some spontaneous post-work beers. God I miss that aspect of life! That, and the fact that there are SO MANY BEER TYPES on tap!!! As you'd imagine, I got the darkest one they had. Nomnomnomnom.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/JCxk6Uvh.jpg" alt="Dark Beer. Nom."></img>

    <p>After some beers with the crew, I motored up north to another one of my old stomping grounds. I didn't have my cleats or my jersey with me, but I put my heckler's uniform on and hung by the fence as my old softball team the Lugnuts hit the field! This was a double-win too, cause they were playing Andy's team, so I got some REALLY good heckling on him to boot!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/KTULhK9h.jpg" alt="Behind the Fence"></img>

    <p>Tuesday - another day of work with a giant plate of Matt's BBQ at lunch. Portland is such a food utopia!!! But after work, I didn't have any plans. I wormed my way back to the hotel and was about ready to just kinda hang out and go to bed early, but I found some motivation and energy, and headed out for a walk.</p>

    <p>With no real route or destination in mind, and being downtown where I didn't normally go, I just kinda set off. The sun was out, the skies were blue, and I was feeling a good bit aimless. Eventually I found myself on the Burnside Bridge, and headed across the river to SE Portland.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/1igYADWh.jpg" alt="Sunlight Alley"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/rEs3EeLh.jpg" alt="Burnside Bridge"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/T8g0ydfh.jpg" alt="Stag Sign"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eUlJcaOh.jpg" alt="Clouds over the Willamette"></img>

    <p>In SE, I meandered my way around and eventually found myself on Stark St. Kinda hungry, I started looking for some grub, and had an old sandwich shop in mind. Unfortunately, Meat Cheese Bread wasn't open for dinner hours, so I was bummed about that. Turning around, I wandered back to Sandy and past my old dance studio, and as luck would have it, there was a class going on! I wanted to stop in and say hi, but not in the middle of class. So right next door was the old taqueria, who looked to have closed down, so I found a spot on the patio and hung out for a while.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/HxTENaNh.jpg" alt="Patio Contemplation"></img>

    <p>This put me in a perfect storm situation - feeling aimless, not sure what to do, in the middle of a big decision I was still torn on, and not feeling too at ease about any of it. I sat on the patio and my mind just jumped around trying to process things. But my mind works very poorly on its own with topics like this, so this didn't help. Thoughts lingering on why I feel alone so often (even on that night in my old city), where do I actually fit or belong in this world (as I'm still unsure where I do), am I actually confident and comfortable with myself, those and more. It's dangerous when my mind is left to turn around and look on the inside. I need to, but still not sure how to process these things on my own.</p>

    <p>Eventually though, it was towards the end of class, so I wandered back over and got to see a few familiar faces, including Melissa and Colin, the teachers! Such great people and incredible teachers, it really made me miss being under their tutelage and dancing in general (last time I danced was in Portland before I moved). Good to see that they've got a limited basis of in-person activities going, and that things are moving along. Not as they normally would, and times are still tough, but it was so great to see them, albeit briefly, and catch up!</p>

    <p>Fromt there, I wasn't in the mood for a drink, so rather than stopping by Loyal Legion, I meandered around a bit and started pointing back towards the hotel. It was dark by now, but it was a nice, relaxing walk before finally jumping into bed.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ocYz3Qph.jpg" alt="Hawthorne at Night"></img>

    <p>Wednesday was another day of work, highlighted by the delicious, infamous, amazing, Gonzalez Taqueria. I learned that, once MS Teams was implemented as the new communication platform at DTNA, Corp-III, my old building, setup a burrito chat. As soon as someone was planning on going to get a burrito or tacos or whatever from Gonzalez that day, they'd throw it in that chat, and whoever wanted in put up their order. What a glorious use of modern communication!!! The place looks a little worse for wear, but the people there are fantastic and the burritos and food in general are incredible!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/H0AIflMh.jpg" alt="Gonzalez"></img>

    <p>That night, I headed down to Milwaukie to go see the Simpsons! Drew and McKenna ended up moving from 82nd area down to Milwaukie with their little one and had a really nice place in a nice neighborhood. I got in and we had a good long while to sit around and chat about the last year+, how they've been, how their little one is growing so quick, how Kingsley (their corgi) is a little drama queen, and just how they both are doing. As always, so great to see and get back in touch with such great people!</p>

    <p>Thursday put me back on the move. Due to some of the current stuff at work, we were off to Madras for some testing. Just as it was when I was back in the group, Madras, our not-so-local test track, has been growing in usage and usability over the last few years, and will be growing further in the coming year (corporate finance is a goddamn mystery box of chaos). Well, we packed up our test truck and hit the road. Thankfully enough, Mt. Hood was waiting there to say hi, and Mt. Jefferson was too. :-)</p>

    <p>Madras was Madras, so nothing too fantastic to share from there. But we did head to Rio, and I finally got my margarita!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/n4ljBQEh.jpg" alt="MARGARITA"></img>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Backstory:</strong>  During Work Week 2 back in Germany before the trip, we had a colleague from Portland, Claudiu, in Wörth as a part of an exchange. We were working late one of the nights updating cameras and things were hitting a snag. At some point Claudiu mentioned margaritas and my knees almost buckled in desire. It was hot out, we were working all day, and that was the only thing that clouded my mind. I wanted nothing else except a margarita.</p>

    <p>The next morning I went over to Safeway to snag some breakfast, and along with the beautiful sunrise that greeted me on the walk over there, sitting there on the shelf was my boy Ryan's hard work!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/IeJiNMkh.jpg" alt="Sunrise"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Rpn23gZh.jpg" alt="Three Creeks on the Shelf"></img>

    <p>Work back on the track went well. Another hot day, a little bit smoky, and we got a few more wrinkles ironed out so we were able to get a little work done. Soon enough though, it was Friday afternoon and it was time to GTFO back to Portland.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/HAnF4Keh.jpg" alt="Camo Truck"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Zf0a4zkh.jpg" alt="RearView Runner"></img>

    <p>After wrapping up the testing, I jumped in a car and made the two-ish hour drive back to Portland. With that, it was time for a weekend I was ready for. My body wasn't going to like it, but it was time to shred!!!</p>

    <h2 id="Shreddy">Ready Shreddy - A MTB Weekend Galore</h2>

    <p>As soon as I knew I'd be coming back, I knew I had to get a ton of riding in with my crazy crew of riding buddies. After some planning, some doodles, a calendar to figure things out, it was right off the bat that worked out for the most people to spend the weekend riding, drinking, and eating up that PNW loam.</p>

    <p>To start it off, I headed off to Andy's house to start things off. We spent the night hanging out and getting ready, and got to once again enjoy some incredible food. Handmade ravioli. Bwuh. Fucking deeeeelicious!!!</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Sidenote:</strong>  HUGE shoutout to my boy Andy. Such a great and incredible friend. He's made the big jump out of Daimler and I'm super pumped to hear how the next step goes! He and Megan are doing great things, are great people, and I'm stoked I got to spend a bunch of time with him during my trip!</p>

    <p>The next morning, we were up and at 'em and ready to go! We loaded up the Tacoma, got the Vitamin R in the coolers, and we were off! First stop...</p>

    <h3 id="Thrillium">Thrillium and Cold Creek</h3>

    <p>The first pit-stop on this weekend world tour was up in SW Washington at Thrillium. This place is known as a trail built to destroy downhill bikes. So naturally, it's a bruiser. But our crew rolled up, did some last bits of fine-tuning, and we were loaded up to shuttle!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/R9HERLth.jpg" alt="Getting Ready"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/B2VSTIsh.jpg" alt="Loading Up"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BnsKkvqh.jpg" alt="The Views in SW WA"></img>

    <p>Well, as luck would have it, we (mostly me) had a good number of tire problems. First run, I got a puncture and I thought the bacon strips would hold the leak. But on Run #2, the puncture wasn't holding, so it was time for a tube! Needless to say, it was a bummer having tire problems right out the gate. But thankfully, I wasn't the only one, because Andy had a similar issue on Run #2 as well. But, after putting in a tube and pumping up the pressure, we continued the shreddage.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/AlnUHi4h.jpg" alt="Crew in Waiting"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Qb5dItQh.jpg" alt="Thrillium Start"></img>

    <p>Thrillium is really a bone-beater. It's a hard trail, full of huge rocks and jumps, and everyone was feeling pretty beat. So after a few runs of Thrillium, we decided to get a little pedal in and rode up the hill to Cold Creek. Bwuh, it was HOT out, so sweat was pouring, but we made it up, and had an awesome ride down to finish out the great first stop along the weekend.</p>

    <p>Post-ride, we took the scenic route out and on the way stopped at another institution of my world in Portland - time for some Banh Mi's!!! It's a total hole in the wall that Andy and I discovered on a whim, and has been pinned with a heart on the map ever since. So I called in the order, and we headed back to Andy's with the delicious treasure to pack up all our camping gear and of course. Chow. Down.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/P9zBPneh.jpg" alt="Banh Mi OMNOMs"></img>

    <p>Spicy sandwich satiation completed, Tacoma re-packed with our gear for the night, and we were off and on the way! First pit-stop was Freddies to gear up on ice and some snacks, then we hit the highway out to a new trail that Andy had been helping to build out. First snag though, the highway was closed. Dun dun dun...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/nbEz6bgh.jpg" alt="Highway Closure"></img>

    <h3 id="Fear">Fear and Loaming</h3>

    <p>Turns out, the highway was closed down due to a major accident down the road. But, the place we were going was before the accident. So after talking to the guy manning the closure, we were given the all-clear to head out and hit the trail!</p>

    <p>It was nice being on a highway with limited traffic, and soon enough we were at the trailhead ready to go! As luck would have it, Jack, another DTNA coworker, was there ready to shred. And I gotta say, that's what we did in a good few ways.</p>

    <p>This was an experience that I would never ever be able to experience in Germany. First off, shuttling is possible, but I have yet to see or ride anywhere where you can drive deep into the forest to get to the trail. That's not present in DE. Next, a big-ass Chevy 3500 long bed doesn't exist over here. That's a big beast. And lastly, and most definitely most prevalent, we were chugging some delicious Vitamin R's to get ready for the ride. THAT, would never, ever happen in Germany. Love it.</p>

    <p>The road up to the trail was long, rocky, and quite the bruiser. So it was a damn good thing we had the big-ass truck to get us up there. And soon enough, we were at the top ready to shred!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eJ1WAL4h.jpg" alt="Loading the Trucks"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/vB6J5bth.jpg" alt="Fear and Loaming"></img>

    <p>Andy and his crew did one HELLUVA job on this trail. What an incredible ride. Tons of variation, some great features, and some great fun in the wonderful PNW dirt. And it's a damn good thing it's a shuttle trail, because the climb up would be brutal.</p>

    <p>Well, I was not riding my bike, but rather a bike Andy was letting me ride (and partly destroy. Sorry 'bout that buddy...). I use this to preface the fact that I was struggling to get comfortable on the two wheels, but riding my little heart out as best I could. But, sometimes I forget I'm not as good of a rider as I think I am. <a class="body" href="https://youtu.be/TDy5mjUIn6E?t=37">Here's a perfect example</a>.</p>

    <p>That was unfortunately the second attempt on that jump, the first I also crashed. But the second was worse, and thankfully it got caught on video. I was a bit shaken up, but shortly thereafter was ready to keep riding. And that's just what we did!</p>

    <p>We ended up getting a couple of laps in on this awesome new trail. Seriously Andy, great work on the digging! Thankfully, I survived, and double thankfully, there was a river right next to the lower parking lot. So after rolling in I stripped down and got to wash off most of the dirt and sweat and blood. That felt unbelievably great.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/qWYWJnhh.jpg" alt="Nial. Survived."></img>

    <p>Wrapping up from there, we headed up to the third stop on our trip, and rolled in just as the sun was going down. With our little crew, and after John decided a ditch was to be a new roadway, we got our little caravan parked and ready for the night.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/4hj9zGmh.jpg" alt="Sunset on the Cascade Range"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/C8lqayih.jpg" alt="Caravan Arrival"></img>

    <p>Beers, burgers, and good times abound as we enjoyed the day of riding with some cold brews and good food at the top of the hill. The stars were out that night to cap every thing off as we all hit the sack ready get some sleep and ready for another day of shredding.</p>

    <h3 id="Ravens">Raven's Ridge</h3>

    <p>Wake up was incredible. A B-E-A-UTiful sunrise over the Cascade Range. And right after that, Andy went full on chef and we had a deeeeelicious plate of eggs, sausage, veggies, cheese, and hot sauce. Bwuh. What a GREAT way to start the day!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eDfjkpwh.jpg" alt="Sun through the Trees"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/RdAinLdh.jpg" alt="Clouds in the Valley"></img><br>
    <img class="pano" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZfgFWfah.jpg" alt="The Morning View"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Nu5tBvVh.jpg" alt="The Morning Grub"></img>

    <p>Raven's Ridge was another trail I'd never ridden before, so it was an exciting start to the day! This one was fun. Rooty, steep, good fun technical bits, and an all around blast. We got a few runs in, and I held out from one drop that I kinda wanted to do but didn't trust myself yet from the day before. Good times at the Ridge.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hVs3pdkh.jpg" alt="Raven's View"></img>

    <p>From there, we lost a couple of the guys in the group due to other committments, but John, Andy, and I were headed down to Burma Peak for the last stop on the world tour. Due to what I had planned directly afterwards, we popped back to Andy's so I could pick up my stuff and my ride in order to leave from Burma directly to what came after the Weekend of Shreddage.</p>

    <p>What this meant though, is that one of the best eateries in the world (in my humble opinion) would be a pre-ride treat instead of the normal post-ride treat. But, I was finally headed home! Well, home being the best taco truck in existence. And HOT DAMN SHE WAS WAITING FOR ME!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/tqca5bfh.jpg" alt="The Salsa Bar"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BBujNGVh.jpg" alt="Order up!"></img>

    <h3 id="Burma">Burma Peak</h3>

    <p>Holy Grub acquired, I rode out to Burma Peak. Soon enough, Andy rolled up and we feasted. Like Kings. In the hot sunlight. Damn tacos are so goddamn delicious!!!!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ea92yPOh.jpg" alt="The Grub"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3F0o052h.jpg" alt="Like a King"></img>

    <p>Bwuh. Seriously. Those tacos and everything that comes from that heavenly taco truck is absoultely unreal!!! But, from there, it was time to ride. The downside of Burma Peak is that it's three mile ride in just to get to the start of the climb. But we cranked that out of the way and planned on waiting for John at the bottom of the hill.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/9VsYKkvh.jpg" alt="Waiting for John"></img><br>

    <p>Well, that was not how it was gonna play out. No service at hand, we couldn't get a hold of him, so after waiting around for a while we started pedaling up the hill. I'm not sure how or why (likely the heat, and the constant movement), but that uphill for me was an absolute bear. I was sweating like a pig completely out of energy pretty much the whole way. It was one helluva slog...</p>

    <p>But partially up, we had cell coverage and connected with John! He was already at the top with Connor, so we kept pedaling with the plan to meet them there. It felt like it took forever, but we made it!</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I only had time for one run. But made it count! Burma is such a fun place to ride. The steep, technical mixed with the poppy jumps, it's an absoulte blast. And with the nothing but dusty powder down, those steeps were even more insane!</p>

    <p>We all made it down to the bottom with nothing but grins and shouts of "HOly SHIT THAT WAS AWESOME!!!". Truly an insane and incredible way to round out an insane and incredible weekend!</p>

    <p>From there, we had the three mile ride back out to the cars. It was a bummer to say goodbye to Andy and John and Connor, but damn, seriously, what an incredible weekend! Still sweaty and dirty, I jumped in the car, pointed the car south, and was headed to Eugene.</p>

    <h2 id="BikeTour"><del>Bend</del>Coast to Coast</h2>

    <p>The next leg of my journey was to start, hold over, and end in Eugene. But the starting meant I got to meet up with my old friend Tyra! We met at Helen's house so I could drop off my car, and then we hit the road a little before sunset to head over the pass to Bend. Thankfully I stocked up at the taco truck, and had a tripa burrito waiting for me to devour after the long day of mountain biking!</p>

    <p>The drive was gorgeous, but it was crazy to see how much damage had taken place due to the fires the previous summer. Lots of barren land and downed/burnt trees, but even with that, what a gorgeous place. Along with the nature, it was great to catch up with Tyra! Really awesome to hear all the big stuff going on in her life and the new chapter she has all lined up!</p>

    <p>Soon enough, a little after sun down, we rolled into Bend and headed to the House of McVay. There awaiting us was a whole gaggle of crazy CBYXers!!!</p>

    <h3 id="Bend">Chilling in Bend</h3>

    <p>To start them off was my man Zack. The reason for this whole reunion is his, as he was on the tail end of the Trans-America Bike Route. Sometime in June he started in Washington, D.C. and had pedaled himself and his bike Beowulf the entire way across the USA. An absolutely incredible feat. And at that point in time, he was rounding up a couple days crashing with Ryan and Helen, and the redheaded wonder Colin who'd come down from Washington!</p>

    <p>So Tyra and I rolled up, and the party just kept rolling. As is always the delight at Ryan and Helen's, there was some delicious tacos flowing and we got to grub up. Follwed by my Mommy's Neiman Marcus cookies and some amazing brews from Three Creeks (Ryan's craft as their pub's head brewer), we were sitting pretty with nothing but deliciousness and good people.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VqsnVMxh.jpg" alt="Dangerous Dudes"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/79GggPAh.jpg" alt="Immortal Justice"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/yrkgYwZh.jpg" alt="What. A. Clown."></img>

    <p>We didn't let time waste itself before really diving into all the delicious goodness and catching up. A really fun night with the whole gang just hanging out and drinking. But soon enough, it was off to bed for another day of drinking, food, fun, and great people.</p>

    <p>The next day, it was a lazy start. Just what the doctor ordered. We kinda rolled around, slowly got out of bed, and then hung out on the balcony at Ryan and Helen's old place for a bit before heading back to Ryan and Helen's new place to start the day. Grub. Always a good way to go. And again, it's like living in a five-star restaruant at their house. No joke.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/9BWxBLuh.jpg" alt="Porch Pals"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/B9GJlWOh.jpg" alt="Up to No Good"></img>

    <p>After a good bit of lounging around and chatting and such, we decided to go out into the world to do stuff. Right around that time, it started raining a bit, which was really needed in the midst of fire season. Made for some nice pictures too.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/So7K7wMh.jpg" alt="Drops on the Window"></img><br>

    <p>After running a few errands and getting some stuff done, it was time for some vittles. And beer, of course. So we headed down to Bend Brewing Co. downtown. First starting out on the lawn, we eventually got a table for lunch and had some good brews to go with it. Otto the puppy was along for the ride and we had a delicious time in the fresh PNW weather.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/rtkB3Ich.jpg" alt="Ryan being Ryan"></img>

    <h4>Bearded Boys</h4>

    <p>So, as we know, Zack was on a big adventure over the summer, biking from Washington, D.C. all the way to the West Coast. That's a helluva trip.</p>

    <p>As it's one less thing to take care of during the trip, he decided he was going to trim his beard down before the trip and let it grow out throughout the journey. Well, as a sign of solidarity (and a bit of a competition), we trimmed our beards down at the same time before the trip! The thought was to take some pictures every couple of days for us to track our beard progress throughout his trip! So that's exactly what we did!!!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/kOepIXm.gif" alt="Nial"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/9SNZZ4E.gif" alt="Zack"></img>

    <p>Two Beards in a Bushel. Isn't that something special :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/r3a0dtCh.jpg" alt="Bearded Boys"></img>

    <h4>...back to the show...</h4>

    <p>From there, Helen headed off, and the crew headed to The Cellar, a basement bar with nothing but cask ales. There was a friendly crew next to us, but the CBYXers got some time to hang out, reminisce, and relax with some more good brews. Cool little bar too.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/n2PpuIZh.jpg" alt="Cask Ales for the Crew"></img>

    <p>Unsure how long we hung out there or what we did afterwards, but eventually we made our way back to Ryan and Helen's. And, because I was in town, I took the opportunity to pop over to my aunt and uncle's place! Nothing like being able to just stop by family and say hi.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, when I pulled up, they were there! It was a total surprise, but Al came to the door and we were able to spend some time chatting. Eventually my cousin Max showed up and holy damn he grew! Crazy seeing your little cousin as an adult! But we got to have some nice time to chat, catch up, and see how they're doing. The visit was way shorter than it should have been, but it was really nice to stop in and see how Al, Sharon, and Max and the rest of their house was doing!</p>

    <p>From there it was back over to Ryan and Helen's to enjoy the night of festivities. They were all lounging around the pool when I rolled up, but soon after, we were back in to backyard barbecue mode. The beers were flowing, we setup some Beersby (aka Cricket), and Good Times were bound to be had.</p>

    <p>The moment we were all waiting (and watching the clock) for was Laura's arrival. She was on the road headed straight from Wisconsin to Bend, and was bound to arrive sometime that afternoon/evening. After much anticipation, she arrived to the party! With the whole gang there, it was time to party.</p>

    <p>The festivities continued with a little more beersby (cricket) and thanks to Ryan's incredible handiwork at <a class="body" href="https://www.threecreeksbrewing.com/">Three Creeks</a>, we had plenty of beer to keep us going. Liquids flowing, the games and fun kept rolling.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/rRHXvydh.jpg" alt="Team South"></img><br>

    <p>As we were playing away and letting the delicious elixir lead to some good times, Helen (and Ryan between his beersby appearances) were working hard away in the kitchen. And soon enough, their hard work was ready for us to enjoy! On the menu - Beef Wellington and Salmon Wellington. I gotta say, having friends that can cook, bake, and brew, all in the same household, hot damn it's awesome. As is always the case in the McVay household, it was DEEEEEEEEEEEEElicious.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/epZw8tvh.jpg" alt="Dinner Time"></img>

    <p>What a wonderfully beautiful night:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Great friends</li>
      <li>Great food</li>
      <li>Great drinks</li>
      <li>Great conversations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just an incredible night with incredible people and incredible things. Really a great time. We drank, ate, and chatted all night and had a fantastic time of it. I don't remember what it was, but it was delicious. With so much good food and enough booze in us though, as it usually does, eventually the night came to an end.</p>

    <h3 id="Coast1">Bend to McKenzie</h3>

    <p>That next morning, it was time to hit the saddles and ride off into the sunset. Well, not quite sunset yet, but it was time to hit the road! Zack had been bumming around Bend for long enough, and me and Laura were saddled up and ready to pedal our way to the coast to help Zack finish off his epic journey!</p>

    <p>We got up fairly early and got all our great readied up and squared away. One thing that we had going for us from the get-go was the support of Colin throughout the way. Although he wasn't pedaling along with us, he was doing us one better. He agreed to br our pilot car for the trip! That meant we could stash our crap in his car, and he'd meet us at the end stop for the day to hang out, drink, and chow down after a long day of riding. Seriously Colin, thank you so much for doing this for us!</p>

    <p>After another wholesome and delicious meal at the McVay's (we'd be seeing them in a bit!), we packed up our bags, got our two wheeled steeds ready to go, and were off to the races!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/P8rPTo3h.jpg" alt="Zack, Prepped"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yibanawh.jpg" alt="Steeds a'Waiting"></img>

    <p>The cool, crisp, and sunny early morning was a great start to our ride. The start of the route got us through the outskirts of Bend to skip as much of town as we could. Soon enough, we were out of city limits and onto the rolling highways of the high desert. Things were off to a good start.</p>

    <p>But soon enough we got our first flat. Unfortunately, first of a string of them. That had us pull to a stop for a while as we went to work patching the tube. It was a quick stop, and soon enough we were back up and running.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/9ecsCGsh.jpg" alt="Starting Off"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/enjrPhsh.jpg" alt="Zack Checking In"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/wZeJI2Lh.jpg" alt="Flat #1"></img>

    <p>Soon enough the backroads met back up with the Highway and we were on our way towards Sisters. That's not exactly a great highway to ride a bike on, but it was really the only route that made sense. Thankfully, we didn't have any issues, had some good music and podcasts going, and had a good little chug going along. Not to make it all work no play, we pulled off at the viewpoint just outside of Sisters to take in the beautiful mountains on the beautiful day!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/NEJTFVzh.jpg" alt="The Highway to Sisters"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/S4zdUqjh.jpg" alt="Laura, Rocking Out"></img>

    <p>Cranking it out. Just a short way after that rest stop, the highway rolls into Sisters, OR. And, as we know, Sisters is the home of the one and only Three Creeks Brewing! Not ones to pass up times with friends, we rolled into the Brewery and said hi to Ryan and Helen.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Xplhj44h.jpg" alt="Entering Sisters"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QCTXWTWh.jpg" alt="The Gang Out Front"></img>

    <p>After walking around the Brewery for a bit and hanging out with Ryan while he was brewing some new Three Creeks brews, we continued on to Sisters proper to run a couple errands. First, we needed some coffee. So Helen joined us as we headed to Sisters Coffee and snagged some java, and I got a bomb-ass cookie to go with it. That was delicious.</p>

    <p>Then, while we had a little civilization around us, we headed over to a bike store so Laura could stock up on a chammois. Totall necessary to have one of those on a trip like this! So she got squared away, I got to ogle at some mountain bikes, and after that we were back on the trail!</p>

    <p>Leaving Sisters, it was time to head up and over the McKenzie Pass. Unfortunately it wasn't the one weekend a year where the highway is closed for bikers and walkers, but thankfully the highway wasn't too busy and ended up being a beautiful ride up and out of the high desert.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hutDQUXh.jpg" alt="McKenzie Pass Start"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/m8uCTgfh.jpg" alt="Gang's All There!"></img>

    <p>Chugging along. From here, it was a lot of uphill to get up and over the pass. Thankfully, it was fairly gradual, so it wasn't a total bear. And despite it being a two-lane road, the traffic was light and the drivers were friendly. Just the combination of things you can enjoy!</p>

    <p>Soon enough though, energy was waning and it was time for a snack break. Not gonna lie, I think I had the best snacks of all time. From the drive over to Bend, I wasn't able to finish the burrito. And thanks to the marvels of modern refrigeration, that was what was waiting for me to devour. HOLY GOD THOSE BURRITOS ARE SO GODDAMN GOOD.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/nARHfYBh.jpg" alt="Zack Snack"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/rJRxQ1uh.jpg" alt="Ruffians"></img>

    <p>All three of us had some time to re-energize and let the calories settle in before hitting the road to continue up the pass. The trees were bare (thanks to some forest fires of years past), and the skies were relatively clear considering it was the middle of fire season. But regardless of it all, it was gorgeous with Broken Top just hanging out behind the trees!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/oYjtluyh.jpg" alt="Broken Top behind the Trees"></img>

    <p>Up and up we continued. Soon though, the trees slowly faded out and were replaced by a giant lava field. And I mean giant. Luckily enough, there was a view point with some pretty informative signs waiting for us. So we pulled off, enjoyed the views, and Laura and Zack had a long and lovely conversation with a couple from Alaska on a tandem bike that were headed across to DC! Quite the long stretch ahead of them, but it was fun watching Zack have some camaraderie with total strangers over an epic journey like the TransAmerica!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/4BYZoifh.jpg" alt="The Gang and the Mountain"></img>

    <p>From that view point, it was just one last push (with a few false summits) until the top. It was getting warmer, but we pushed on. Slowly, surely, we kept on keeping on.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7adwkY1h.jpg" alt="The Sisters to the North"></img>

    <p>And soon enough, we'd reach the top of the pass! It was a bit anti-climactic, but the top was clear enough which brought a damn nice feeling of accomplishment!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/W9ZjcWAh.jpg" alt="The Summit!"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3MGw6huh.jpg" alt="Lava Rock Observatory"></img>

    <p>Reaching the top, as always, requires a little celebration (and in this case, some food and a long break). We stashed our bikes on the side of the parking lot, snagged our vittles, and headed to the top of the observatory to enjoy the view and fill up our bodies with some calories. Still a clear day, and what a view!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/zpLLaxTh.jpg" alt="Mountain Sundial"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/aOLNfoch.jpg" alt="Views to the West"></img>

    <p>At our previous snack stop, I smartly only took a few nibbles, and thankfully still had almost half my burrito ready to devour!!! That paired with our summit beers, we all started snacking and drinking away, cooling down from the long pedal uphill, diving into some delicious food, and chatting all along the way.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BSKpMc0h.jpg" alt="FVCK COVID"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3mCclnzh.jpg" alt="Success"></img>

    <p>We did a good job of relaxing and hanging out at the top. It was a clear day (at the moment), and it was nice to sit around with some great biking buddies. Once we'd had our food-fill, we wandered around the observatory. If I remember correctly, it was built entirely out of the lava rocks from the area, and was built during the many works projects from the Great Depression. One cool thing about it, on the inside, the window slits (tall and vertically built) all/mostly point directly towards nearby peaks! Jefferson had it's own viewing portal, Hood (a bit far away), the Sisters, all of them! Pretty cool design!</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, as we were lounging around and then exploring the observatory, our luck with clear skies had kinda run out. The smoke from the nearby mega fires of the summer had made their way to our presence, and it made quite a noticeable difference. Despite that, we were lucky, because we had a nice, long downhill stretch ahead of us.</p>

    <p>The approach from Bend to the top of the McKenzie Pass was smooth, gradual, and honestly quite doable. And hotdamn I'm glad we were going East to West, because the descent down from there was insane. Around 4000' vertical drop over 22 miles, once we started going from the top of the pass (and got over a few hills to start), it was a thing of beauty being able to coast all the way down the pass!</p>

    <p>On the one hand, going so damn fast on a road bike on pavement had me sketched the hell out. There were tons of switchbacks and tight curves, and the grip of road tires on asphalt is worlds away from the grip of dirt tires on singletrail, which is what I'm used to. All that sketchiness aside, damn that was a fun descent. Fast wind blowing by your face; no/little energy needed to go forward, down, and fast at that.</p>

    <p>I was really enjoying the ride. Taking the curves at speeds a little faster than I thought the tires could handle, but enjoying the hell out of the roller coaster ride that started in lava fields and eventually maneuvered down to the forest.</p>

    <p>After what seemed like way too quick a time, eventually the road started to flatten out a bit and turn into a much more gradual descent. Bummer. But that means we were almost done for the day! The road eventually spit out to the highway, and it was a great sight to see Zack and Laura roll up with waving hands and smiling faces!</p>

    <p>From the highway junction, it was just a little ways up the road to the campsite that we'd agreed with Colin in the morning that was our end target for the day. Unfortunately, we were in a cell phone dead zone, and were running on intuition rather than communcation to find our scouting party.</p>

    <p>After a little hunting and searching, we were treated to an absolute goldmine. As I mentioned, Colin was doing us a helluva solid by being our scouting party. Well, he went above and beyond the call with finding us an incredible campsite, and getting us all set up and squared away! It was a delightful reunion as we rolled up to camp, and Colin gave us the grand tour at our evening's lovely little abode right on the river.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/r8zHU6wh.jpg" alt="Our Lovely Little Campsite"></img>

    <p>After our long day of riding, we started relaxing like champions. Snackage, beerage, and a general spot of cooling down. It was nice and relaxing. So much so, that after a good bit of snacks and beer, I whipped over to my cot and popped off for a nap. As always, any day is a good day when you can squeeze a nap in!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ouDuqI4h.jpg" alt="Bier Beer"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/aTHg7sZh.jpg" alt="Spot the Napper, Courtesy of Zack Herhold"></img>

    <p>The nap was fairly short-lived. But as you can imagine, a wonderful experience. Once I woke up, it was time to think about dinner. And we didn't just think, but we went to town making some Chili Mac. Thankfully it was already underway as I was napping, but I was unfortunate to wake up to the fact that Zack let the first batch of noodles dump into the campfire while straining them. Oops...</p>

    <p>No bother! We didn't let that dampen the dinner. Soon enough we had some cheesy chili and noodles to devour paired with some delicious beers supplied by Ryan. It was fucking delicious.</p>

    <p>Not quite catatonic after the meal, we were ready for a little action. And thanks to Colin's incredible wheels, our action had us in the car and off to the races. The plan was to head to the local hot springs to soak and loosen up after the day's riding.</p>

    <p>It was only a short drive away from camp, but unfortunately the results were disappointing at best. The hot springs were part of a hotel, and we'd arrived about a half hour when the closed down to non-guests. Whomp whomp whomp. :-(  Needless to say, we were a little bummed. But a big old bear helped get our spirits back in line, and bring to mind a backup plan.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lKI8Byih.jpg" alt="Zack and Laura"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/kM9SIhch.jpg" alt="Zack and Colin"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/zhx0xfrh.jpg" alt="Zack"></img>

    <p>I'm pretty sure our backup plan is due to some research on Zack's part, but we all loaded back into Colin's Subaru and headed toward the Terwilliger Hot Springs. Thankfully we had a car, because this would not have been doable after a long day of biking.</p>

    <p>The road up was pretty steep, and long, but it took us up a pretty cool valley past Cougar Falls and the Cougar damn and along the Cougar Reservoir. This was a fun road for Colin - tight turns and sharp curves, and we had some great views of the valley as we kept going further and further in, wondering if we were actually heading to something or going on a goose chase.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/sqpCPmjh.jpg" alt="Mined Hill"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/wzp6Su9h.jpg" alt="Natural Dam"></img>

    <p>Well, the road eventually was closed off with some giant concrete blocks. Not to be too crazy, there were a couple cars parked in the area, so we parked and walked toward the closure, and were greeted by a sign for the hot springs and a trail. I popped to the bridge to see the lake and then caught up with the crew on the hike up to whatever was at the end.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/88hHPmuh.jpg" alt="Cougar Reservoir"></img>

    <p>A bit of a washed out trail, dusty and up and around a couple hills and trees, but eventually we stumbled upon something quite awesome. At the top of the tiny canyon was a little hut, and leading down the stairs led us to four cascading hot springs. What an awesome find!!!</p>

    <p>There was a group of folks already there, so we kept to the upper pools and were surprised by some really hot water. Not like a jacuzzi, this shit was burning. Although I'm not normally one for really hot water, I got in and got used to it with the gang.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/TUINsH6h.jpg" alt="The Pools"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XY9PvCFh.jpg" alt="The Gang, chillin'"></img>

    <p>After Day 1 of a long ride, damn that felt great. It took me a while to get acclimated to the super hot water, but once I did, it was extremely soothing. We chilled around for a good amount of time to let the body get into full relaxation mode.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/gLnzXvOh.jpg" alt="Colin, Suave"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/dyIUi2th.jpg" alt="Nial, Sumberged"></img>

    <p>At the side of the top pool was a little side pool. During one of my stretches of cooling off outside the hot pool I went up to check it out. As luck would have it, it was a little mini ice bath! Super cold water, right next to the super hot water. Lately, I'd been getting into jumping into a really cold water bath after a long bike ride or hike, so I took advantage of this ice pond to give my legs and knees a chance to cool down. It may be weird, but it felt really good.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/kstePAjh.jpg" alt="Nial's Cool Pond, Courtesy of Zack Herhold"></img>

    <p>After me, a couple of the other kidlets took a turn in the cold bath. Seriously, it feels good after the shock and aids good recovery after a long day. Not a bad way to go.</p>

    <p>We did some good lounging and hanging and relaxing. Gotta say, that was a helluva little oasis tucked in the back of nowhere! Taking advantage of as much daylight as possible, we hung out until right as the sun was almost down. Once it started getting dark though, we packed up and headed back to the car.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/v49CXpdh.jpg" alt="Colin's Last Dip, Courtesy of Zack Herhold"></img>

    <p>The hike back to the car was pretty short, and soon enough we were back in the Subbie and taking the squirrely road back to the campsite. Before we got all the way out, we pulled over onto the dam as darkness really set in to enjoy the clear night and beautiful skies amidst the mountainy fresh air. :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/GicSNzxh.jpg" alt="Down the Dam, Courtesy of Laura Borth"></img>

    <p>From the beautiful overlook on the dam, we packed back into the car and had a short trip back to the campsite. Unfortunately, as it was the middle of the summer and fire season was in full force, a campfire was not in the cards. We hung out for a bit, drank some more delicious beers, shot the breeze, and then eventually all packed it in on a nice warm summer's night.</p>

    <h3 id="Coast2">McKenzie to Eugene</h3>

    <p>Sleeping out in the open was nice and cozy, but waking up felt a little weird. As I got up and at 'em, I took a look at my mattress pad and was immediately saddened by the giant blister that had developed right at neck-level. Welp, there goes that stalwort piece of equipment, as there's no fixing that amount of delamination...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/2Zc5pc6h.jpg" alt="So Long, Dear Mattress"></img>

    <p>After not-quite getting over the sadness of the loss, I got up and at 'em and the morning began. Everyone else was already up, but now it was time to chill around, eat some grub, and pack up. We took no rush in doing any of those things, and made a nice morning of it all.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CxPoVreh.jpg" alt="Camp Table Shenanigans"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/6iOP7CTh.jpg" alt="Camp Steward Extraordinnaire"></img>

    <p>Soon enough though, it was time to wrap up and jet out! We finished packing everything up into the Subbie, said a first goodbye to Colin as he was off for his daily adventure, and then me, Zack, and Laura grabbed our two-wheeled steeds and we were off! Happy to get one quick picture of the four of us though on the way out!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/9sBkhTrh.jpg" alt="Gang's All Here!"></img>

    <p>The start of the ride was pretty smooth and straightforward. The trees were big and beautiful and green all around, and the crisp, cool morning air felt good breezing on by. Thanks to a calm morning, the traffic was low and we enjoyed the first good few miles to start the day!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5TezrqPh.jpg" alt="Curves in the Forest"></img>

    <p>After not-too long, a bit of civilization appeared on the left in the form of a down-home gas station/restuarant/local grocery store. Taking on to Zack's thousands of miles of bike touring wisdom, we popped in for a morning break and snack. There was quite the eclectic mix of things in there, but we all got some snacks, Laura had a bit of a battle to find a bathroom, but after all was said and done, we enjoyed a cup of coffee on a curb out front watching the world come and go.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/G31CNDah.jpg" alt="Nut Cheese"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0JNoVQ1h.jpg" alt="Coffee on teh Curb"></img>

    <p>That was a really relaxing stop. The fresh morning, warm coffee, and just sitting there chatting with friends. A great little extra, calm kick start to the day.</p>

    <p>After the coffee, it was time to keep pedaling. The morning was still cool, but started to gradually heat up as we cruised along. Along with the increase in heat, we also transitioned to a much more open roadway, all thanks to entering the burn area from a year or two before. All the trees were toasted, toothpicks, and burnt to a crisp. It was a terrible sight to see at a slow speed and for so long. That fire really had one helluva devastating impact.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/gZKxjd6h.jpg" alt="Burnt Forest"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/mnCeyHIh.jpg" alt="Open Skies from the Burn"></img>

    <p>Despite the heat and burning sun, we kept pushing along. I was out ahead, and eventually pulled off into some shade to wait for a bit and let Zack and Laura catch up. What I thought was gonna be just a quick stop and go, turned into a longer wait than I anticipated. Not sure what was going on.</p>

    <p>I waited a little longer, and then knew something had to be up. So back I pedaled. Just as I guessed, something was up. Unfortunately, Laura got another flat, and repairs were in process. Zack was doing some magic on the tube and soon enough, we had her bike back up and running and were back on the road!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/tp6heish.jpg" alt="Repair Work"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/r7CcR6Wh.jpg" alt="Sketchy Repairman"></img>

    <p>Some more pedaling, some more motion, some more road, and the tour goes on. As the day progressed, more traffic kept zooming by, but it was pretty bearable. All of a sudden though, we came upon a giant traffic jam, as we got to ride slowly by dozens of cars and trucks just parked on the highway.</p>

    <p>We made short time of getting to the front of the line, and as were were biking, we had a little more freedom to move around, which included being able to talk to the guy holding the stop sign. Turns out, there were some giant machines on the roadway working to clear some of the tons of trees and debris from the fire, so the highway was being throttled for the day. No matter, just means we had some time to hang out and chat as we waited for the green light.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/IebxSKUh.jpg" alt="Bikes at the Ready"></img>

    <p>That green light eventually came! But first, all the cars and trucks got to zoom on by before us bicyclists. Safer that way, but waiting is boring. Eventually though, the vehicles were done and we had complete freedom to cruise on down the highway! Sometimes waiting can bring something nice your way. ;-) Also, those were some giant cranes throwing those logs and dead trees around. Wouldn't mind being able to play with one of those for a day!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/153GoH7h.jpg" alt="Free Ridin"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ehRNgHvh.jpg" alt="Log Machines"></img>

    <p>Once we got past the road blockage, it was more cruising and smooth sailing as we slowly knocked off the miles on the way towards Eugene. The next milestone was another random one. It was a little past midday, we were all pretty hot in the beating sun, and there happened to be a fruit stand sitting on the side of the road. Nothing like a good reason for a lunch break!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZwpryiOh.jpg" alt="Bike Train"></img>

    <p>Next to the stand (I think on the neighbor's property) were a couple park benches, so we slowly rolled over thataway and dropped our bikes in a slight bit of exhaustion. After gathering ourselves, we headed over to the fruit stand to acquire some vittles for lunch.</p>

    <p>They had quite the good selection, so we all assembled what turned out to be a pretty delicious lunch. While perusing, it came out that Zack had biked all the way from DC, and the high school gal manning the till was absoultely dumbfounded that A) he'd biked that whole way, and B) that someone would even think of it. She was totally shell-shocked.</p>

    <p>But with food in hand, we wandered back over to the bikes and benches and had a nice time slowly getting some sustenance in the shade. Nothing like a nice, relaxing break with some great folks on a great adventure.</p>
