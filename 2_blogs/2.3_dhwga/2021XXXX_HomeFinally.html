    <p>After the incredible week of mountain biking in Châtel, I had to hit the ground running and never had the chance to stop and breathe before my path finally pointed me in the direction I've been longing for - Home. Before we get to the good 'ole USofA, I had a couple weeks of hecticness at work to make sure I focused and couldn't look too far ahead of what was to come.</p>

    <a class="body_ctr" href="https://www.polarsteps.com/NialTilson/4136754-home-finally?s=A219DDBA-0544-4AAC-8479-011FDC13E124">Spark Notes - My Polarsteps Journey</a>

    <h2 id="TwoWeeks1">Two Weeks to go...</h2>

    <h3>Week 1</h3>

    <p>What did I walk into when I got back from France? Pure and utter chaos. All thanks to the terrible delivery from our supplier the day before I took off, and the fact that it seems like nothing happened the week I was gone, Monday through Friday of the first week was pure chaos. Whereas we normally receive software drops once every three months or so, we got six SW drops over four days that week. The icing on the cake, the SW we got on Friday was the right one, but they had to re-compile it for it to be official. So what's that mean? We got the actual final SW on Monday of the second week. JeebusHChrist.</p>

    <p>All that meant long days each day of the week. Testing the new SW, finding the issues, reporting them back, and seeing if the supplier was going to do anything about it. That, all paired with trying to maintain a bit of a life outside of it, I was not home very much. When I was, it was either eating or sleeping, and for some reason for both weeks, I wasn't sleeping well at all. That just added to the stress.</p>

    <p>The weekend between work weeks ended up being really nice. Friday night I tore apart my bikes in order to prep the forks, shocks, and droppers for delivery. I decided to send them off to a workshop while I'm gone to get them rebuilt and service. If I won't be riding my bikes, might as well use the time efficiently, right?!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/smgnxrih.jpg" alt="Tranny Taken Apart"></img>

    <p>Saturday morning was delightful, as Christoph came over for some scrambled eggs and english muffins. A delicious, relaxing, and wonderful breakfast to start the weekend, and then we chatted about my next project that he supplied the idea for. More on that to come once it gets underway!</p>

    <p>Post breakfast, it was nap time. And holy shit I needed it. I passed out hard as soon as I hit the red chair. Conveniently enough, I was out for a good two hours and woke up with just enough time to get out the door. First stop was Tübingen to drop off my bike parts. Got that squared away, and next stop was over to the Hollowells!</p>

    <p>This was a bit of a bittersweet stop, as they only had 20 days left in Germany before their move back to Detroit. So this was the last time I'd be able to come over and hang out and crash with them. But we made it more than fun! Steaks, grilled octopus, indoor racquetball, Catan, another wonderful weekend with my wonderful family. Sad to see they're moving back home, but happy to hear about the great opportunities they'll all be getting into once they're back!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iS0S2fBh.jpg" alt="Quite the Sport"></img>

    <p>A laid back morning again hanging out, chowing down, and relaxing with the gang was really nice to wake up to. After relaxing on the balcony for a bit, they squared me away with a ton of moving-away goodies, and I jumped from them to go see my good buddy Yann. Sad to realize that we hadn't seen each other since Slovakia the past year, but we met up and went for a nice little walk around his part of town.</p>

    <h3 id="TwoWeeks2">Week 2</h3>

    <p>The second week ended up being more stressful. Work kinda teetered off a bit, but there was still a ton to do. Due to the delay in a functional software, what I was supposed to be doing over the past three weeks, I had to cram as much of it into the week before departure as I could. To add to that stress, emotions slowly built up throughout the week coming from a number of corners of my mind. All that coupled with the lack of sleep really just wore me down.</p>

    <p>I don't know how, but Tuesday night I got my cry in. Or at least part of one. Wasn't sure how it came to be, but cruising reddit I just got heady, and started bawling. Thinking about a lot of things and it all just came to a T. I had been feeling it coming on for a good while, but despite the need, a few days later everything was kinda back to where it was - emotions high and refilling the dam of tears.</p>

    <p>Friday eventually rolled around, and I was done. Donezo. Finished. Useless. COVID test in the morning followed by PT, then off to work. I don't know if I really got anything useful done, but I was there, and struggled through the day. Finally being able to leave and start trip prep, I was just drained. Made it home, haircut, laundry, and time to pack.</p>

    <h2 id="Home">Finally Headed Home - The Journey Begins</h2>

    <p>It was one helluvan early Saturday morning, but my flight at 06:00 meant an early up and out. Thankfully, I had everything well enough squared away the night before to where I just needed to shower, grab my stuff, and hit the road.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/0Mjds2Bh.jpg" alt="Excited and Ready!"></img>

    <p>For getting to and from the airport, I had a different setup for parking. All the lots at the airport were either full or godawfully expensive, so I signed up to drop my car off at the terminal, someone/company would take it to a parking lot, then when I return, I'd give them a call and they'd deliver Rupert back to me. At least that is/was the plan</p>

    <p>Well, it was a weird wait for the guy to come get my car once I got to the terminal, and it kinda got me worried. But after realising it was a misunderstanding on my end and Rupert was in (hopefully) good hands. From there I walked into the terminal an DAYUM having priority status is nice. It was a super short line at the counter and I got my bags, tickets, and COVID paperwork all squared away. Soon enough I was through security and into the airport - the first time since moving over here.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZZvFwuxh.jpg" alt="Short Priority Line!"></img>

    <p>On the one hand, the whole experience was super weird. The first time flying in over a year and a half, and first time in the pandemic and everything. Much stricter rules and a few more hoops to jump through.</p>

    <p>But on the other hand, it all kinda felt both the same, and as if it hasn't been nearly a year and a half since the last time I flew. Tons of people, it's all chaotic, but despite it all people somehow make it to their flights without killing each other. Kinda weird to see so many damn people too, just nuts.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, getting up and out of Stuttgart was quite the breeze. I didn't have to wait too long for our flight to take off, and getting into Amsterdam was gorgeous, with a beautiful sunrise at takeoff, and sun glinting off the harbor in Amsterdam as we came into town.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/RH3LvkVh.jpg" alt="Sunrise leaving STR"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QUZMWhPh.jpg" alt="Sunrays arriving at AMS"></img>

    <p>As soon as I got out of Germany though, a notable difference. Hearing English everywhere again threw me off immediately. So weird to be able to hear every conversation around and not be able to tune it out. That's one of the benefits of living in a foreign country where the local language is not your first language.</p>

    <p>Through screening and into the lounge for some grub and some time to sit around. Overall almost four hour layover, but once I got to a seat in the lounge and had some food, I only about two hours to hang out before heading to the gate. Enough time to relax, do some writing, and take a breather.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">DISCLAIMER:  everything above this was written close to the the time it happened. Everything afterwards, however, was not, and is being written at least a month or two after the fact. I stupidly didn't take notes during the trip, so it's all a good bit doing my best to remember what I can.</p>

    <p>After a bit of lounging around, I decided to head to the gate a little early for a little more walking before jumping into another aluminum tube. The excitement was slowly building, as I was one step closer to being back home. Boarding went well enough and we were up in the air in no time. I was pretty pumped for the start of the flight, but some cloud cover prevented me from doing some high-up scouting of my next trip. The map on the display-thing was kinda sweet though.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/S1QM4y0h.jpg" alt="Scotland from Above"></img>

    <p>After a long-ish flight, I was back in the US. Not quite home, but at least on home-soil. Landing in Seattle, went through customs (which was a BREEZE. I still can't get enough of Global Entry), and it was weird to have SeaTac as my first entry point. But I was officially welcomed back into the US, and then was waiting for my puddle jumper to head back to PDX.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/i3a7ugqh.jpg" alt="Welcome to the USA"></img><br>

    <p>Landing in PDX was quite the relief and surprise. Relief, finally out of the airplanes and airports and could take my mask off. And who do I take my mask off to? Nearly the whole family waiting on the bridge for me. You know it - the waterworks couldn't hold back any longer. A nice big long hug with Mommy made me know I was finally back home. :-)</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/CnyU3rLh.jpg" alt="Me and Mommy"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eLhhmU9h.jpg" alt="The Welcoming Crew"></img>

    <p>Mommy, Alicia and the kids, and Peewee, who drove down from Richland just to welcome me back, were all there to welcome me back home to the USofA for the first time in a year and a half. What a great way to start things!!! I had my bags, we loaded up, and headed back to the hotel near the airport to hang out together.</p>

    <p>Some happy hour, some chips and salsa, and some relaxed time to see each other and catch up. I was pretty tired, but it was so great to see the family. Jerffrey and Harmony were full of energy, and it was great to see them, Alicia, Peewee, and Mommy again.</p>

    <p>While I was in Amsterdam, I was stopped off at a gift shop and got a shirt each for Jeffrey and Harmony. So while we were hanging out, I ran down to the car to get them from my suitcases. First I gave Jeffrey his, and he was pretty excited. Then I showed Harmony hers, and I will never forget the unbridled excitement that she let rip after she saw the shirt. It was so funny and so pure! I asked her if she wanted me to put it on her, and the only thing she could say was "yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah" with a gigantic smile. I'll never for get that!</p>

    <p>Well after some hanging out, the kids were gearing for the pool, so Mommy and Alicia joined them, and I ended up passing out on the couch for a while. I was out cold, and quick. But soon enough the gang was back and we had a little more time to hang out, watch some planes land at PDX, and just take it easy. But, soon enough my eyes were dropping, and I headed downtown to my hotel to get some sleep.</p>

    <p>Once I got to my hotel though, got checked in and squared away, but somehow got a bit of a second wind. So instead of just sitting there waiting to fall asleep, I walked the few blocks down to the Willamette, got called a jackass probably three times in the six blocks there, and found a bench to take in my (former, but kinda current) city. A beautiful night to do so.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Db2Y4PKh.jpg" alt="The River S"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/irTw3s9h.jpg" alt="The River N"></img>

    <p>Eventually though, it was off to the room, and off to a poor night's sleep. Thanks jet lag.</p>

    <h2 id="Start">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>After the restless nights' sleep, I was up and moving to head back to the family for a little more time to hang out and catch up. On the way though, I had to start my reunion tour of some Portland staples. First stop - See-Sees Coffee for a little java. I rolled up right as they opened, and the guy opening was running a little late. So I grabbed a couple chairs to throw on teh sidewalk. Well, a little helping hand goes a long way towards a free cup of coffee! With my java, I jumped by Henry Higgin's Bagels for some sammiches, then was back at the hotel with the family.</p>

    <p>Some great noms, some great people, some planes coming in to land, all makes a relaxed way to start the day with the family.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/nEmG0UIh.jpg" alt="Plane Spotting"></img>

    <p>Around mid-morning though it was time to split. Peewee had a long drive back to Richland, Alicia, Mommy, and the kids were gonna go bike the Trillium Bridge, and I was off to go get some sweat out of me through the thing that's consumed my life (in a good way). We got in another picture, bid adieu, and we were off to re-meet in a couple weeks time.</p>

    <p>From there, I was off to the House of Duvall to meet up with my best bud Andy! One of the biggest things that's missing in my life in Germany is my mountain biking buddies. So as you could imagine, it was such a great sight to see that bundle of energy. Got there, had some McDonald's ready for our/my pre-MTB breakfast, got the bikes loaded up, and we were off to go shredy!</p>

    <p>The cra ride was nothing but catching up and hearing how life's been treating him and Megan and getting back in the swing of being home. Soon enough, we'd made it to Rocky Point and a few other bear hugs for Colin, Clayton, and Lindsey were waiting! Bikes repacked and we were headed up the hill. Gah, finally having my freeeends back in my life - such a great relief!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/v3xuZTXh.jpg" alt="Andy Preppin"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/dKRvliNh.jpg" alt="Smiles All Around!"></img>

    <p>Well, it was hot as shit out, but damn what a treat to be back home in the beautiful PNW. It was a clear day, and on our sweaty tour of Rocky Point we crossed a couple spots with wide-open views of the area, and I couldn't not stop, take a few deep breaths, and realize how much I miss the PNW nature. Mt. Hood, Portland, greenery, blue skies, all just absoultely breathtaking.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ngwQ3Wvh.jpg" alt="Mt. Hood. A Beaut"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/6U4xlQth.jpg" alt="The Gang Ready to Go"></img>

    <p>Another day in the PNW, another day with great friends, and another great day of riding in the books. It was hot, sweaty, but a damn good ball of fun with some great people on great bikes riding some great trails.</p>

    <p>Me and Andy loaded back up and then headed back to his place, and I was invited to stay, hang out, and grub up with Andy, Megan, and Obi the pup! What a treat! It was the perfect way to catch up with Megan and Andy, and pet their new dog, enjoy some DEEEELICIOUS food (they'd been really honing their culinary skills through COVID - steaks, elotes, and amazing everything!), and just enjoy a wonderful evening with some absoultely great people.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cgNxZRxh.jpg" alt="Andy Doing Andy Things"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/brMJAAIh.jpg" alt="Key to Elotes"></img>

    <p>Seriously, they know how to make some delicious food. So we chowed down hard, had some drinks, and I learned a new board game. But, unfortunately, tiredness eventually caught back up to me. It was an absolute delight to see and catch up with Andy and Megan. Such great people.</p>

    <p>From there, it was back to the hotel to hope I could get some sleep. Surprise, jet lag.</p>

    <h2 id="WorkWeek1">Week 1 - Work</h2>

    <p>As I'm good at doing, there was no time to waste being back in town, and two days after I'd landed it was back to Swan Island and back to work. Not fun, but it's one of the reasons I was able to have such a long trip. So up and at 'em, back to Corp III I go!</p>

    <p>Overall, work was fine. It's work, so what can I say. But being back in Portland and being able to jump back into my old team, which is the team I interact with the most from my role in Germany, was pretty nice. Great to see how they're working, what they're succeeding in, but difficult to see and verify the many differences between Germany and Portland, especially trying to figure out how to communicate those differences so the folks in Germany will realize/internalize them. Either way, work stuff went well.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/WHE5RHRh.jpg" alt="DTNA Lobby"></img>

    <p>Monday started things off pretty quick, with some good work and getting to see a bunch of former colleagues. Then, in one of the truest differences between US and German work culture, right after work I headed up to the local dive bar for some spontaneous post-work beers. God I miss that aspect of life! That, and the fact that there are SO MANY BEER TYPES on tap!!! As you'd imagine, I got the darkest one they had. Nomnomnomnom.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/JCxk6Uvh.jpg" alt="Dark Beer. Nom."></img>

    <p>After some beers with the crew, I motored up north to another one of my old stomping grounds. I didn't have my cleats or my jersey with me, but I put my heckler's uniform on and hung by the fence as my old softball team the Lugnuts hit the field! This was a double-win too, cause they were playing Andy's team, so I got some REALLY good heckling on him to boot!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/KTULhK9h.jpg" alt="Behind the Fence"></img>

    <p>Tuesday - another day of work with a giant plate of Matt's BBQ at lunch. Portland is such a food utopia!!! But after work, I didn't have any plans. I wormed my way back to the hotel and was about ready to just kinda hang out and go to bed early, but I found some motivation and energy, and headed out for a walk.</p>

    <p>With no real route or destination in mind, and being downtown where I didn't normally go, I just kinda set off. The sun was out, the skies were blue, and I was feeling a good bit aimless. Eventually I found myself on the Burnside Bridge, and headed across the river to SE Portland.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/1igYADWh.jpg" alt="Sunlight Alley"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/rEs3EeLh.jpg" alt="Burnside Bridge"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/T8g0ydfh.jpg" alt="Stag Sign"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eUlJcaOh.jpg" alt="Clouds over the Willamette"></img>

    <p>In SE, I meandered my way around and eventually found myself on Stark St. Kinda hungry, I started looking for some grub, and had an old sandwich shop in mind. Unfortunately, Meat Cheese Bread wasn't open for dinner hours, so I was bummed about that. Turning around, I wandered back to Sandy and past my old dance studio, and as luck would have it, there was a class going on! I wanted to stop in and say hi, but not in the middle of class. So right next door was the old taqueria, who looked to have closed down, so I found a spot on the patio and hung out for a while.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/HxTENaNh.jpg" alt="Patio Contemplation"></img>

    <p>This put me in a perfect storm situation - feeling aimless, not sure what to do, in the middle of a big decision I was still torn on, and not feeling too at ease about any of it. I sat on the patio and my mind just jumped around trying to process things. But my mind works very poorly on its own with topics like this, so this didn't help. Thoughts lingering on why I feel alone so often (even on that night in my old city), where do I actually fit or belong in this world (as I'm still unsure where I do), am I actually confident and comfortable with myself, those and more. It's dangerous when my mind is left to turn around and look on the inside. I need to, but still not sure how to process these things on my own.</p>

    <p>Eventually though, it was towards the end of class, so I wandered back over and got to see a few familiar faces, including Melissa and Colin, the teachers! Such great people and incredible teachers, it really made me miss being under their tutelage and dancing in general (last time I danced was in Portland before I moved). Good to see that they've got a limited basis of in-person activities going, and that things are moving along. Not as they normally would, and times are still tough, but it was so great to see them, albeit briefly, and catch up!</p>

    <p>Fromt there, I wasn't in the mood for a drink, so rather than stopping by Loyal Legion, I meandered around a bit and started pointing back towards the hotel. It was dark by now, but it was a nice, relaxing walk before finally jumping into bed.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ocYz3Qph.jpg" alt="Hawthorne at Night"></img>

    <p>Wednesday was another day of work, highlighted by the delicious, infamous, amazing, Gonzalez Taqueria. I learned that, once MS Teams was implemented as the new communication platform at DTNA, Corp-III, my old building, setup a burrito chat. As soon as someone was planning on going to get a burrito or tacos or whatever from Gonzalez that day, they'd throw it in that chat, and whoever wanted in put up their order. What a glorious use of modern communication!!! The place looks a little worse for wear, but the people there are fantastic and the burritos and food in general are incredible!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/H0AIflMh.jpg" alt="Gonzalez"></img>

    <p>That night, I headed down to Milwaukie to go see the Simpsons! Drew and McKenna ended up moving from 82nd area down to Milwaukie with their little one and had a really nice place in a nice neighborhood. I got in and we had a good long while to sit around and chat about the last year+, how they've been, how their little one is growing so quick, how Kingsley (their corgi) is a little drama queen, and just how they both are doing. As always, so great to see and get back in touch with such great people!</p>

    <p>Thursday put me back on the move. Due to some of the current stuff at work, we were off to Madras for some testing. Just as it was when I was back in the group, Madras, our not-so-local test track, has been growing in usage and usability over the last few years, and will be growing further in the coming year (corporate finance is a goddamn mystery box of chaos). Well, we packed up our test truck and hit the road. Thankfully enough, Mt. Hood was waiting there to say hi, and Mt. Jefferson was too. :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Z5CSOByh.jpg" alt="On the Road"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hbuPxoHh.jpg" alt="Jefferson"></img>

    <p>Madras was Madras, so nothing too fantastic to share from there. But we did head to Rio, and I finally got my margarita!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/n4ljBQEh.jpg" alt="MARGARITA"></img>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Backstory:</strong>  During Work Week 2 back in Germany before the trip, we had a colleague from Portland, Claudiu, in Wörth as a part of an exchange. We were working late one of the nights updating cameras and things were hitting a snag. At some point Claudiu mentioned margaritas and my knees almost buckled in desire. It was hot out, we were working all day, and that was the only thing that clouded my mind. I wanted nothing else except a margarita.</p>

    <p>The next morning I went over to Safeway to snag some breakfast, and along with the beautiful sunrise that greeted me on the walk over there, sitting there on the shelf was my boy Ryan's hard work!!!</p>

    <p>Work back on the track went well. Another hot day, a little bit smoky, and we got a few more wrinkles ironed out so we were able to get a little work done. Soon enough though, it was Friday afternoon and it was time to GTFO back to Portland.</p>

    <p>After wrapping up the testing, I jumped in a car and made the two-ish hour drive back to Portland. With that, it was time for a weekend I was ready for. My body wasn't going to like it, but it was time to shred!!!</p>

    <h2 id="Shreddy">Ready Shreddy - A MTB Weekend Galore</h2>

    <p>As soon as I knew I'd be coming back, I knew I had to get a ton of riding in with my crazy crew of riding buddies. After some planning, some doodles, a calendar to figure things out, it was right off the bat that worked out for the most people to spend the weekend riding, drinking, and eating up that PNW loam.</p>

    <p>To start it off, I headed off to Andy's house to start things off. We spent the night hanging out and getting ready, and got to once again enjoy some incredible food. Handmade ravioli. Bwuh. Fucking deeeeelicious!!!</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Sidenote:</strong>  HUGE shoutout to my boy Andy. Such a great and incredible friend. He's made the big jump out of Daimler and I'm super pumped to hear how the next step goes! He and Megan are doing great things, are great people, and I'm stoked I got to spend a bunch of time with him during my trip!</p>

    <p>The next morning, we were up and at 'em and ready to go! We loaded up the Tacoma, got the Vitamin R in the coolers, and we were off! First stop...</p>

    <h3>Thrillium and Cold Creek</h3>

    <p>The first pit-stop on this weekend world tour was up in SW Washington at Thrillium. This place is known as a trail built to destroy downhill bikes. So naturally, it's a bruiser. But our crew rolled up, did some last bits of fine-tuning, and we were loaded up to shuttle!</p>

    <p>Well, as luck would have it, we (mostly me) had a good number of tire problems. First run, I got a puncture and I thought the bacon strips would hold the leak. But on Run #2, the puncture wasn't holding, so it was time for a tube! Needless to say, it was a bummer having tire problems right out the gate. But thankfully, I wasn't the only one, because Andy had a similar issue on Run #2 as well. But, after putting in a tube and pumping up the pressure, we continued the shreddage.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Qb5dItQh.jpg" alt="Thrillium Start"></img>

    <p>Thrillium is really a bone-beater. It's a hard trail, full of huge rocks and jumps, and everyone was feeling pretty beat. So after a few runs of Thrillium, we decided to get a little pedal in and rode up the hill to Cold Creek. Bwuh, it was HOT out, so sweat was pouring, but we made it up, and had an awesome ride down to finish out the great first stop along the weekend.</p>

    <p>Post-ride, we took the scenic route out and on the way stopped at another institution of my world in Portland - time for some Banh Mi's!!! It's a total hole in the wall that Andy and I discovered on a whim, and has been pinned with a heart on the map ever since. So I called in the order, and we headed back to Andy's with the delicious treasure to pack up all our camping gear and of course. Chow. Down.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/P9zBPneh.jpg" alt="Banh Mi OMNOMs"></img>

    <p>Spicy sandwich satiation completed, Tacoma re-packed with our gear for the night, and we were off and on the way! First pit-stop was Freddies to gear up on ice and some snacks, then we hit the highway out to a new trail that Andy had been helping to build out. First snag though, the highway was closed. Dun dun dun...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/nbEz6bgh.jpg" alt="Highway Closure"></img>

    <h3>Fear and Loaming</h3>

    <p>Turns out, the highway was closed down due to a major accident down the road. But, the place we were going was before the accident. So after talking to the guy manning the closure, we were given the all-clear to head out and hit the trail!</p>

    <p>It was nice being on a highway with limited traffic, and soon enough we were at the trailhead ready to go! As luck would have it, Jack, another DTNA coworker, was there ready to shred. And I gotta say, that's what we did in a good few ways.</p>

    <p>This was an experience that I would never ever be able to experience in Germany. First off, shuttling is possible, but I have yet to see or ride anywhere where you can drive deep into the forest to get to the trail. That's not present in DE. Next, a big-ass Chevy 3500 long bed doesn't exist over here. That's a big beast. And lastly, and most definitely most prevalent, we were chugging some delicious Vitamin R's to get ready for the ride. THAT, would never, ever happen in Germany. Love it.</p>

    <p>The road up to the trail was long, rocky, and quite the bruiser. So it was a damn good thing we had the big-ass truck to get us up there. And soon enough, we were at the top ready to shred!</p>

    <p>Andy and his crew did one HELLUVA job on this trail. What an incredible ride. Tons of variation, some great features, and some great fun in the wonderful PNW dirt. And it's a damn good thing it's a shuttle trail, because the climb up would be brutal.</p>

    <p>Well, I was not riding my bike, but rather a bike Andy was letting me ride (and partly destroy. Sorry 'bout that buddy...). I use this to preface the fact that I was struggling to get comfortable on the two wheels, but riding my little heart out as best I could. But, sometimes I forget I'm not as good of a rider as I think I am. <a class="body" href="https://youtu.be/TDy5mjUIn6E?t=37">Here's a perfect example</a>.</p>

    <p>That was unfortunately the second attempt on that jump, the first I also crashed. But the second was worse, and thankfully it got caught on video. I was a bit shaken up, but shortly thereafter was ready to keep riding. And that's just what we did!</p>

    <p>We ended up getting a couple of laps in on this awesome new trail. Seriously Andy, great work on the digging! Thankfully, I survived, and double thankfully, there was a river right next to the lower parking lot. So after rolling in I stripped down and got to wash off most of the dirt and sweat and blood. That felt unbelievably great.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/qWYWJnhh.jpg" alt="Nial. Survived."></img>

    <p>Wrapping up from there, we headed up to the third stop on our trip, and rolled in just as the sun was going down. With our little crew, and after John decided a ditch was to be a new roadway, we got our little caravan parked and ready for the night.</p>

    <p>Beers, burgers, and good times abound as we enjoyed the day of riding with some cold brews and good food at the top of the hill. The stars were out that night to cap every thing off as we all hit the sack ready get some sleep and ready for another day of shredding.</p>

    <h3>Raven's Ridge</h3>

    <p>Wake up was incredible. A B-E-A-UTiful sunrise over the Cascade Range. And right after that, Andy went full on chef and we had a deeeeelicious plate of eggs, sausage, veggies, cheese, and hot sauce. Bwuh. What a GREAT way to start the day!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eDfjkpwh.jpg" alt="Sun through the Trees"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Nu5tBvVh.jpg" alt="The Morning Grub"></img>

    <p>Raven's Ridge was another trail I'd never ridden before, so it was an exciting start to the day! This one was fun. Rooty, steep, good fun technical bits, and an all around blast. We got a few runs in, and I held out from one drop that I kinda wanted to do but didn't trust myself yet from the day before. Good times at the Ridge.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hVs3pdkh.jpg" alt="Raven's View"></img>

    <p>From there, we lost a couple of the guys in the group due to other committments, but John, Andy, and I were headed down to Burma Peak for the last stop on the world tour. Due to what I had planned directly afterwards, we popped back to Andy's so I could pick up my stuff and my ride, in order to leave from Burma directly.</p>

    <p>What this meant, it would be a pre-ride treat instead of the normal post-ride treat. But, I was finally headed home. Well, home being the best taco truck in existence. And HOT DAMN SHE WAS WAITING FOR ME!!!
