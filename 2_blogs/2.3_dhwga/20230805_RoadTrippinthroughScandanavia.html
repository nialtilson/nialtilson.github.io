    <h1> ROAD TRIPPIN' THROUGH SCANDANAVIA </h1>
    <br>

    <p>Outdoor Adventure. Flexible Exploration. Those two in combination have made up the best trips and experiences I've had in my life. Last summer had one or the other in my adventures, but not having that combination left me really wound up after that with a clearly negative effect. I'd been stressed and stir-crazy for a good while, and it was having an impact.</p>

    <p>So after getting a little taste of adventure in Morocco, a very unique and interesting country, I wanted more. Now. Now wasn't quite in the cards, but the wheels started turning for what my summer could turn into, and boy-howdy did those wheels spin to something great. Thankfully I'd built up a good amount of overtime, so once it came to, it was 5 weeks away from the world and off on a big-ass road trip up through Northern Europe. Oh yeah baby. Here. We. Go.</p>
