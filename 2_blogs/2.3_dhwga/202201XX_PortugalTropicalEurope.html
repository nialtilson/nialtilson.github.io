    <p>Unfortunately, flying home for the holidays wasn't in the cards. Already having gone home during the summer helped make that issue a little better, but it was definitely a bummer not being able to be with the family over the holidays.</p>

    <p>But, dear reader, Fear Not! Despite being stuck in Europe, I was going to have a special visitor. My man Mr. Herhold made plans and jumped on a plane to make his way over to Europe and say hi! The plan, hang out in Karlsruhe for a bit and then jump in the car and head down to a little sunshine and red wine in Portugal! After being hampered by Covid for a couple years now, this Well Oiled Machine (R) was underway. Great to get the adventure train rolling again.</p>

    <h2 id="HerholdTrain">The Herhold Train Rolls In</h2>

    <p>After being completely done with work for the year, on my first free day I had to wait until mid-afternoon for Zack to be coming into town. I knew when his plane landed, and he planned on going solo from Frankfurt down to my place to start the trip. That gave me a laid-back morning to pack and get thigns ready for the journey.</p>

    <p>I went grocery shopping for some road snacks, got some things packed, and ended up having a date over lunch to meet up with a cool gal. Unfortunately, I ended up cutting it a bit short. Why? Why would I cut a good date short? Well, Zack was without a phone on his trip down from the airport, and I didn't want to not be home when he hit the klingel at my apartment.</p>

    <p>But the rush was a bit for naught. Zack got caught up in the airport (as I found out when he got in), but I headed home and played some video games until the loud "DING DONG" arrived. Zack, welcome to my apartment!</p>

    <p class="quickhit">Weirdly enough, Zack's the first person from my life in the US to visit me and my life here in Germany. Totally makes sense - Covid has shit on all of our lives - but the ability to finally host someone so important in my life was such a treat!</p>

    <p>Once he got in, we hung around my place for a hot second, but then were off and riding around town. We only had an afternoon in town, so I went through my very short list and we jumped on our bikes to hit the town. The first stop was something I see every time I ride my bike to work, and knew he would get a kick out of the very communist-like figures outside of a random apartment building.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/WS4IAYxh.jpg" alt="Communism in Karlsruhe"></img>

    <p>We rode out to the statues, and on our ride back home we stopped off to get our Covid tests done before we hit the road the next day. Luckily enough, there was a test station on the way back that had nobody waiting, so we signed up, got our noses swabbed, and were on our way.</p>

    <p>With the bikes dropped back off at home, we walked toward the town center to get a taste of the town on foot. First stop was some Glühwein. Although the christmas markets were closed, no way we could pass up that tradition while he was in town.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/MZx4EDVh.jpg" alt="GlühWein and Dine"></img>

    <p>We walked through BasisLager (sporting goods store), and walked down the main drag and past the remnants of the christmas market before jumping into Marktlücke for some dinner. Good grub and decent beers, then we walked home. After a few drinks at home to catch up and lounge around it was time for bed to get ready to roll!</p>

    <h2 id="Day1">Day 1 - Off and Running</h2>

    <p>After a quick night's sleep, it was time to go! We woked up, got cleaned up, made sure all our bags were packed and ready, and headed down to Rupert to get ready for the trip. We made quick work of getting situated and ready to go, and before we knew it, we were all packed and ready! But before we headed out, we walked over to the bakery for a croissant and some coffee. A little bit of energy and bread before we hit the road!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/GSyqZ4Gh.jpg" alt="Things are Ready"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/dkowQA0h.jpg" alt="Rupert and Zack - Thumbs Up!"></img>

    <p>To start things were pretty easy sailing. Heading south towards and past Freiburg, it was a bit rainy, but not too bad, as we then entered into France. At some point I questioned why we were on all these small roads. Well, I somehow left the option to avoid toll roads still clicked on from my trip through Scotland, and that had us on a scenic stroll through the countryside of France. I ticked that option off, we rerouted and cut two hours off the planned travel time. Sahweet. Cruising, cruising, cruising, and 6 hours later, we ended up in Vichy!</p>

    <p>Right back to the many benefits of having a history buff along for the ride, Zack did some scouting of good places we could stop at, and the town of Vichy was right on the way. The former capitol of the non-occupied region of France from WWII, that name popped up to Zack, and as he did some research, we learned that it is also a spa town! Why not get in a little soak and some mineral water along the way!?</p>

    <p>We rolled in, parked, and the spa building was just around the corner. Zack was all stoked about filling up on some mineral water to heal all of his worries. But, as luck would have it, the building with the water sources was closed. Annual cleaning during Christmas Eve. Damnit...</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/bZ2Iojqh.jpg" alt="Dwight Eisenhower Alleé"></img>

    <p>Our spirits a little dampened, we started strolling around town to keep our legs active and start the first opportunity for some wandering and exploring of the trip. A little hungry, I snagged a deeeeelicious cookie, and then we headed towards the big main park.</p>

    <p>After walking through the park we ended up in a small plaza on the far side. Looked left, and there was a big 'ole WWII memorial. Zack was (as always) a great person to have along for this, because he informed me of the interesting nuance here. We were wary of how much reverence was going to be engraved hinted towards the history of the nazi-sympathizers. Although we google-translated one of the signs (and things looked to be allied, not fascist), the skepticism still remained.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/LnCvjnth.jpg" alt="WWII Memorial"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/D6F79zHh.jpg" alt="Big French Building"></img>

    <p>From the park we wandered around and explored some of the tiny sidewalks (seriously, barely wide enough for one person), the cute alleyways, and old buildings of the town before turning back around for the main drag. Now we were on the hunt for a little snackage, and luckily stumbled upon a pretty good looking bagel sandwich shop. With our grub in hand, we wandered once again back to the park and plopped down on a great bench to enjoy our snacks and do some people watching in the brisk afternoon.</p>

    <p>Rested, walked, and grubbed up, we were back on the road with Zack at the helm. It's always weird being a passenger in your own car, but the chance to sit back for a bit was a great change. But, that was slightly short-lived, as the jet-lag came up and bit Zack in the ass. So, after yet another toll gate we stopped and swapped out.</p>

    <p>Now I did not go in and confirm this with my own eyes (I was and still kinda am in complete disbelief), but Zack went into the bathroom at that stop and came out with quite the shock. Apparently, this pit stop had a squatty potty.</p>

    <p>My first thought - no fucking way. Squatty pottys are found in Asia, not in Europe. I was in such disbelief, that I made Zack recount his weird experience and even draw a picture of the toilet he was describing:</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/sCyvUvKh.jpg" alt="Squatty Potty Crime Scene"></img>

    <p>No matter how little sense it made and how much disbelief I had, there was a squatty potty at a tiny rest stop toilet in the middle of France. That made and still makes no sense to me, but it's legit. What the fuck. And, <a class="body" href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=squatty+potties+in+france">after further research</a>, it seems it's not just a one-off thing, which makes it even weirder.</p>

    <p>On the road though, the miles went by pretty fast, and soon enough we made it to Bordeaux for the night. Had to kinda weave through town in the newly set darkness, but we made our way to the hostel, got checked in and squared away at the fairly swanky but pretty inexpensive spot, and then headed off for a little walkabout.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/gWJLID0h.jpg" alt="A Grain Silo Lobby"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eF97ah9h.jpg" alt="Stop Light Wall"></img><br>

    <p>First goal - dinner. Unfortunately, we were faced pretty quickly with the realization that it was Christmas Eve and a lot of things were closed. Wouldn't be the only time during the trip. The first couple places we googled were black and shuttered for the holiday, so we ended up walking up and down the little harbor area near our hostel. Our only option was the boat restaurant, so we headed back for that.</p>

    <p>Luckily enough they had space, so we got in and sat for a delightful Christmas Eve dinner. The language barrier made things pretty interesting, but we got things squared-enough away and waited for our vittles. This was my first foray into beef tartar, and it was an interesting choice, definitely not my favorite. Despite that, the wine was delicious, their definition of a salad was weird, but it was a nice little dinner.</p>

    <p>Once we paid, we were back off and walking, headed to something Zack spied on his quick research of town. I don't remember the full back story of why it's there, but in Bordeaux, where the little harbor area near our hostel was built, is a former U-Boat bunker. An absolutely MONSTROUS hunk of concrete, just right in the middle of a fairly large modern city. Of course, WWII history comes right to the top, so we made our way over.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, it's closed to the public, but it is an absolutely MASSIVE structure. Seriously, just massive. Essentially a garage but for submarines, this thing had 11 bays for subs to pull into. Subs are no small vehicles, so just envision how immense this place is.</p>

    <p>Trying to take advantage of the night time and a cool subject, I whipped out my tripod to get some night photography practice in. Well, my camera is old and I'm a mediocre photographer, so things didn't turn out very well. I struggled to find a focus point and most of the pictures I took turned out poorly (unfortunately not just that night, but for most of the whole trip :-( ). Zack was super patient with me (as he always is!) as I fuddled around with my hunk of junk before I packed it in and cut my losses.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/IvvjtFkh.jpg" alt="U-Boat Far"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cKRgL2xh.jpg" alt="U-Boat Side"></img>

    <p>After some time capturing and admiring the size and brutality of the concrete behemoth, we wandered around the side to see if we could find a way in. Unfortunately no luck with that. It was sealed up pretty tight. But, as we read on a random sign on the wall, there was some kind of art exposition/marketplace that usually was on the complete other side of the building that opened up during the day. Just something we'd have to dream about as we were only there for the night.</p>

    <p>Lucky and pumped we got to see that giant concrete block, but a bit bummed we couldn't spelunk around inside it, we slowly wandered back towards the hostel. Once there, we grabbed a couple beers, played some backgammon, then turned down for bed.</p>

    <h2 id="Day2">Day 2 - Portugal or Bust</h2>

    <p>Merry Christmas from Bordeaux! We decided to get up fairly early-ish to hit the road in the hopes of seeing some of Portugal in the daylight. After getting showered and ready to go, we got totally stiffed on the parking. The guy at the counter had no idea what we were talking about (supposed to get ~50% off at the parking garage for staying at the hostel), so we were screwed on that front. How the fuck does that aspect of important things about that job get skipped over?</p>

    <p>Quite peeved, we payed the ticket to get out of the garage, packed back into Rupert, and got back on the road. But, before leaving the street, we remembered to go fill up our water bottles. So I stopped and ran back in, and by that time another gal was there who said we could get our parking discount now. Well that's too fucking late... Seems like an intentional scam, jerks. But she did give us some pity coffee along with filling up our water bottles. Doesn't quite make up for it, but it was a nice gesture of understanding.</p>

    <p>Now, water in hand, we were back on the road. Breakfast was the absolute best breakfast one could ask for on a Christmas on the road. I'm not sure how I restrained myself, but I kept a whole bag of my Mommy's Nieman Marcus cookies saved just for this trip. Now, with a damn good reason to crack them open, we snacked on some delicious oatey-chocolateyness to get our day started off right. Then, to go with the sweets, Zack threw on <em>Shadow Divers</em>, a true story about the discovery of a German U-Boat sunk off the New Jersey coast. If you haven't read it, it's quite the enthralling book, and we made some really good headway on that throughout the day.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/wvIM5arh.jpg" alt="Nieman Marcus - Breakfast of Champions"></img>

    <p>Cruising, cruising, cruising, and soon enough we'd made it to Spain! This was my first time in Spain, and I was really surprised and enjoying the beautiful landscapes of the Western Pyrenees. We hit the road before sunrise, and around the time the sun was coming up was when we crossed into Spain and got to see some gorgeous stuff. Ther was one spot where there was some snow higher up, but the rest of the landscape was just a high-desert alpine. Really unique and beautiful.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/36LF7sWh.jpg" alt="Bienvenidos a España"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/LmVRcHBh.jpg" alt="Dawn on the Road"></img>

    <p>Slowly, the further south and west we got, the alpine aspects morphed to purely desert and things got pretty barren. Not completely barren, there was still some sparse foliage, but you could tell things were a bit different. The route we took was generally through really empty land, few  towns and not a ton going on. But slowly the mountainous influence came in and out of presence as we continued on.</p>

    <p>Somewhere in BFE Western Spain we stopped. It was quite the interesting spot. Zack went into get something, and after I gassed up I went into pay. Well, he got completely overlooked with a family trying to buy a Sim card, and as I came in I got ushered right up to the counter. Kinda weird and interesting considering he stood there for a good while ready to check out while the check-out lady just focused on the other family. Different country, different tendencies I guess.</p>

    <p>Continuing to progress through Western Spain, we slowly got back into another mountain range, and this was the one that meant we were getting close to the border! I was pretty shocked by the type and setup of these mountains, and was really enjoying the views along the drive. We kept creeping closer and closer to the Portuguese border, and eventually we had to jump off the highway for the last stretch. Typical to now-annoying google form, the map took us along the literally quickest/shortest possible route, which meant driving through people's driveways, some interesting and really tight/thin roadways, and just getting the feeling google maps doesn't understand what it's supposed to do. It was along this stretch though that we got our first realization of just how tight buildings can be built next to each other and still somehow fit a road in between them...</p>

    <p>We had to kinda dodge and weave our way through some neighborhoods and things, but eventually we whiddled our way back to some semblance of an actual highway. That was a nice change. Along that highway, we mirrored a pretty incredibly dry reservoir that was looking pretty drastic. We stopped to check that out for a bit.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5TRCpWUh.jpg" alt="Bridge over No Water"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/u8Bkeb0h.jpg" alt="Rupert Resting"></img><br>

    <p>Back in the car, we kept chugging along, and soon enough we'd reached the first 'official' step of our trip - we made it to Portugal!!! The border wasn't quite indescript but not all that extravagant, but the distaste between Spain and Portugal was very clear, with a distinct delineation of where the border lays along the bridge. Love a little rivalry in broad daylight. But yeah, we were now in Portugal! Woohoo!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xEfpe7Mh.jpg" alt="Rupert in Portugal!"></img><br>

    <p>After a few shots and celebrating reaching our destination country, we continued a little further on down the road to make it to the village of Lindoso. In researching for this trip I found a list of some cool random off-the-beaten-track things to see in the country, and this village was one of them. The thing this place was known for were it's raised stone granaries riddling the town. From the pictures they looked pretty cool, so I was intrigued to see what they looked like in real life.</p>

    <p>We rolled into the super quiet town and parked near the castle. After a short walk up, we strolled right into a 13th Centry Castle with a 17th Centry Fortress built around it. Pretty damn cool bits of history. Zack tried to be sneaky and head in first to conquer the place, but the gloves he threw on me (which he borrowed from me) didn't quite have the same effect of keeping me out of the place like burning oil or a cannonball would have. Nice try buddy...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/OqJ8MtZh.jpg" alt="A Fitting Sign"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/RFXp0qJh.jpg" alt="Outer Ramparts in Nature"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/YQmPh5Kh.jpg" alt="An unsuccessful 'Conquerer'..."></img>

    <p>The castle interior was closed, but the grounds were open, so we did some 'splorin around the old ramparts. It was a fairly simple and straightforward fort/castle, but pretty cool to check out and walk around. Up on the walls we had some decent views of the town and valley despite the mist and clouds, so a good little romp around in the light rain was had.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5OkHB9Mh.jpg" alt="Castle Crest"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/z2SRNjPh.jpg" alt="The Local Hills"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ODzbrB5h.jpg" alt="Castle from Below"></img>

    <p>Then it was off the castle and down to the granaries. The description was quite fitting, as we waltzed up to about 50+ of them sprinkled throughout the hillside. It was honestly a very unique setup, and after the driving around later, seemed to be a pretty prevalent setup throughout the area.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bdgtpszh.jpg" alt="Zack Marching Down"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/wdoFasKh.jpg" alt="Granaries from the Castle"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/aVyHCOuh.jpg" alt="Granaries Up Close"></img>

    <p>All of them a good bit elevated (between 2-4ft off the ground), and all with slightly varying lengths, they were all made from very precisely cut stonework. To allow for aeration, the sides were made from columns with small gaps in between the columns to allow for ventilation (some out of stone, some out of wood), and it looked like the floors were some slatted wood (maybe, wouldn't make sense but that's kinda what it looked like).</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/1n55pZUh.jpg" alt="Wood Sides"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vPaE6wHh.jpg" alt="Lichen Walkway"></img>

    <p>Zack and I meandered between a good few of them, admiring the stonework and seeing the unique structures up close. Our meandering had us meet up, continue strolling along, and then after another loop through the field with the granaries, we ended up down on the village road and waltzed back to Rupert. A cool little village tucked in the mountains, and it ended up being a really nice quick break in the misty mountain air.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/KesOyndh.jpg" alt="Quiet Village Road"></img>

    <p>Back in the car, we flipped around and headed back the way we came for a bit. Why? Well on the map there was the appearance of a really straight valley with a scenic little road going through it, so I figured that could be a fun drive to take us on our way to Porto. Although the valley looked like someone took a smooth line of frosting off the top of a cake, the road was anything but straight.</p>

    <p>The cruves started early on and didn't slow down the whole way. But, shortly after the valley started there was a massive waterfall over on the other side, so we found a turnout and pulled off to enjoy it. Kinda felt like as soon as we got out of the car, we got approached by this really boisterous Portuguese dude (who lives in Zurich), asking one of us to take his picture. He threw out some really unique poses and shared his really unique, bubbly, and interesting character with us. He was nice enough to return the favor for Zack and I, and after he zoomed off in his Audi, we hung out a bit to take in the valley and waterfall before continuing on.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/JaM2ssIh.jpg" alt="That Waterfall"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VrYyiKwh.jpg" alt="A Winter Roadway with Shades of Fall"></img>

    <p>The windy road continued and made its way up the valley, until eventually, at the crest of the pass, we re-entered Portugal to really dive into our Portuguese adventure. As the road made its way downhill, we ended up stopping a couple times to take in whatever views were there with the sunlight fading, clouds and fog setting in, and the day trying to come to a close.</p>

    <p>At the first of such spots, where all the cars were parked totally cattywhompus, we met our crazy Portuguese buddy again who was doing a whirlwind of a run to just snap pictures and continue on. Had a quick chat with him before he screamed on further along on his adventure, and Zack and I both got some laughs at his fun banter and interesting way about him.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CAnh7xGh.jpg" alt="Stone Tower"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/19KWlHWh.jpg" alt="Mist in the Mountains"></img>

    <p>Once we came down from the higher elevations and entered a few towns, I really got some vibes of previous travels. The first one was Northern Italy, as we passed through a tiny group of towns huddled around a big lake in the mountains, reminded me a good bit of my hike above Lago do Logano in Italy. Bit tropical and warm, reddish/greenish hues all over, mountains, lakes, tiny little towns tucked along the lake, and a generally nice little spot.</p>

    <p>Then, in later spots, Nepal was blasting through my head (as it has a lot lately). There were a number of spots with some small villages tucked up high on the hillside, way above the road and other towns. Those kinds of villages were everywhere along the Annapurna Circuit, so that reminder and comparison was really cool to see.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/soXcT8vh.jpg" alt="A Portuguese Mountain Lake"></img>

    <p>The road kept winding forwards as it worked its way down the mountain valley. Zack was pretty K.O. from the jet lag and feeling a bit under the weather, so I had a relaxing drive down the valley in the darkness. The road eventually opened up to a large valley as we descended in towards Porto, and the drive was absolutely beautiful, despite the nickling and diming of the toll roads. The roadways and overall infrastructure got pretty chaotic as we got closer and closer, but eventually we made it into town and headed towards a hostel.</p>

    <p>After rolling up, the first hostel we stopped at wasn't accepting guestes for the night. That was pretty weird (it was Christmas though...), so a little dejected, we posted up on the sidewalk and did some research. After finding a spot, we headed over, and were greeted to a place that didn't give two shits about COVID. Despite that surprise, we got in and were greeted by the super friendly staff to get us checked in.</p>

    <p>With our beds all set, parking was the next thing to figure out. Luckily enough there was a parking garage nearby, so we headed over there to give Rupert a nice place to sleep for a couple days. In the chaos of getting our bags out I couldn't find the car key for the life of me. Ended up being on the roof of the car. You know, where normal people put the damn keys...</p>

    <p>But with our stuff in hand, we headed back to the hostel. We were both pretty tired, so after getting our beds all situated, we headed to the common area and just hung out and chatted over our lovely Christmas Dinner.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/PBgikEOh.jpg" alt="Christmas Beer"></img>

    <p>We weren't up for too long. But, after two days of driving, we were finally in Porto and Portugal and ready to start our adventure. Off to bed we went ready to get underway in the morning.</p>

    <h2 id="Day3">Day 3 - Rainy Day Discoveries</h2>

    <p>It was a lazy wake up that day as the light rain pattered the walkways outside the window. It was nice to roll around for a while, take it easy, and slowly ease into the day. But before long it was up and at 'em with a shower and getting ready to go. Breakfast was had at our wonderful hostel for a dirt cheap 3.50€, and after the friendly folks handed us our grub and we polished it off, we were off and running for the first walkabout of the trip.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, I jumped back to the room to spur-of-the-moment change my socks to something a little thicker and some warmer clothes, turned out to be a really good and important call. Once we were out on the streets, we jumped right into that lightly pattering rain to start our adventuring. It wasn't coming down too hard as we took a stroll through one of the main plazas and zig-zagged our way across town to our first stop.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/os1hdDmh.jpg" alt="Main Square and Statue"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ML0d3ych.jpg" alt="The first of MANY Alleys"></img>

    <p>Although it was a quiet and rainy day after Christmas, we got to Livraria Lello and there was already a line crossing the street of people waiting to get in. What's more, this place charged entrance to get in! I'd never seen that from a bookstore before, and it must be a big deal then. But, since this apparently looked pretty cool (and we didn't have too many other things on our mental map of things to do in the rain), we hunkered down and waited our turn.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/KaGcd6gh.jpg" alt="Livraria's Line"></img>

    <p>Turns out it was maybe not a big deal, but a really cool deal. Livraria Lello is an old, small, quaint, colorful, and beautiful book store. I'm too lazy to google it, but I think it was also an inspiration for a few things Harry Potter-related (JK Rowling lived in Portugal for a while), and was full of super ornate wood carvings and plaster stuff made to look like wood. That with the red carpet, the muted lighting, incredble artwork on the cieling, this was definitely a cool place to check out.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/tQVT6j6h.jpg" alt="The Main Staircase"></img>

    <p>On the top floor there were a couple installations that were really quite interesting. The first, and one I got more interested in, was a dedication to José Saramago. Portugal is a fairly small country, but José made this country proud, becoming the only Portuguese-language Literary Nobel-Laureate. As you can imagine, that's a big deal, and they had a whole room dedicated to him and his work. I read up on a bit of what he was known for, his background and life, and after a little spur of the moment, got one of the few english translations available for <em>Death at Intervals</em>. I'm almost done with it (at the time of writing), and it's quite the interesting and unique book.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/fq0mef1h.jpg" alt="José Saramago"></img>

    <p>The other section on the top floor was all about the Nobel Prize in general. On one side of the room they had those who had actually won the prize. And on the other side, were those that could have won it, were candidates, or who were snubbed. Through all of the information and a lot of Zack's help, I learned how much controversy revolves around the Nobel Prize, and the fact that there's an alternative prize that has been growing in notoriety to combat the prejuidices and controversy behind the original nobel. One cool thing about this was seeing probably my favorite author, Haruki Murakami, present on the wall! He's been speculated to be have been nominated for a nobel prize and it was awesome to see some connection with him and some well-deserved recognition!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/5xbcLsBh.jpg" alt="Lello from Above"></img>

    <p>We both did a good bit of perusing and enjoying the little store, tons of books to look at and gain some insight into. But, as always, it was eventually time to move on. That meant back out onto the wet streets of town. Despite the pretty consistent rain, we implemented one of our travel modes, <strong>Strategic Wandering</strong>, and were off and running. Cool statues, beautiful buildings, tons of UNESCO heritage plaques, gorgeous small alleyways (those are EVERYWHER in Portugal), and lots of history.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/AbO2w2fh.jpg" alt="Statue and Path"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/KoZ81GTh.jpg" alt="Tiny Alleyway in the Rain"></img>

    <p>Our wandering eventually had us stumbling upon a wonderful little overlook, which gave us our first views of this cool, quaint, and beautiful little city. Despite the rain, the big bridge(s), big river, buildings on cliffs, and hills and terrain next to the mighty River Duoro were all really cool to look out over and explore. We took our time enjoying the views, seeing the city from above, and then were back off and wandering.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ckQ5nefh.jpg" alt="Rundown Building on Overlook"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CKNC4DEh.jpg" alt="Calem"></img>

    <p>Now that we had a general idea of what the city looked like and where some things were, we set out with the intention of heading over to the top deck of the big bridge. Well, we ended up slowly working our way down the hill, through some small alleys, past a statue or two, and then soon enough we popped down out next to the waterfront. Every alley and road we were on seemed to be not only old, but in some way historic; it was a beautiful place to stroll around through.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cEt93HTh.jpg" alt="Butcher on the Corner"></img>
    <p class="quickhit">I noticed this awesome dude up by the overlook, and ended up finding a good few of him painted up around town!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/qVRex4kh.jpg" alt="Yellow and Red Alley"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/E77py70h.jpg" alt="Henry the Navigator in the Rain"></img>

    <p>By that time things had gotten pretty wet. The rain had picked up a little bit, we were both pretty drenched, and to make matters worse, my camera was no longer turning on. Fuck, that had me worried.</p>

    <p>The walk along the waterfront (despite the rain) was really gorgeous, but we both agreed we needed to find a place to take a load off for a bit. The hunt for a café landed us at this one place and the lady was super nice, but the first question was if we wanted food. We were unsure, and then she said she didn't open for another 40min. Coffee was the main thing on our mind, so we kept wandering along.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/zDAqkhbh.jpg" alt="Watery Waterfront"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/26Fsyiuh.jpg" alt="An Old Archway"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CRWApGhh.jpg" alt="The Bridge Overhead"></img>

    <p>Our wandering took us under the big 'ole bridge and along a row of houses/buildings, but there was nothing café-like there. That was a bit of a surprise and bummer, so we backtracked, and on the way stumbled upon a funicular traincar that headed up the hillside. In the interest of finding somewhere quick, we opted to jump in and head up to a different part of town. This was quite the cool setup, and headed up much further on the hill than I anticipated.</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Quick Thought</strong> - The giant bridge connecting the two sides of Porto is a stunning visual landmark and piece of architecture. Through the plaques and info that we found of it though, there was a little shade thrown on the designer that we couldn't stop laughing about. In a few places, the bridge was credited by being designed by "a student of Gustav Eiffel". Although the bridge is an incredible work of engineering and art, the guy who did all the work is completly overshadowed by his teacher. What a poor chap...</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/fHlaCgIh.jpg" alt="Other side of the Bridge"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VWhGmK5h.jpg" alt="Butcher on the Block"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/82k8Z06h.jpg" alt="Porto Hbf"></img>

    <p>Just to our luck, the end of the funicular put us in a proverbial café dead zone. Not ideal, as we were getting wetter by the minute. I whipped out the googlez and found a group of cafes, so we started heading that direction, which ended up being right next to the main station. Our route had us coming down hill, and all of a sudden there were a bunch of tunnels heading into the hillside and the train platforms right next to them. Quite a interesting spot to put in a train station, but with the amount of hills and water and elevation change, they did a pretty ingenious job of it.</p>

    <p>Train stations mean main squares, main squares mean lots of people, and lots of people usually mean restaurants and cafes and such. Luckily enough, that held true here. Zack stopped into the tourist office to snag a map, then we picked out a delicious looking bakery to dive into some coffee and the renowned world of Portuguese bakeries.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, it was delicious. Being out of the rain definitely helped, but the coffee was warm and the goodies we got were scrumptious. They had an entire wall of sweets and baked goods in view, and it was hard to pick. The chocolatey-mousse muffin type thing I got though was spot on, and Zack got something great too. Hard to have to choose when everything looks so good. And no joke, I think Portugal blows German bakeries out of the water.</p>

    <p>While out of the cold and the rain, we took the time with our coffee and sweets to ideate of what we wanted to do next. The rain was really raining on our parade, so the idea was to find stuff to do out of the weather. Zack looked up some museums and figured out where they were. A couple were on the other side of the river, and because of the rain, he didn't want to get stuck over there. But, for a few reasons, we ended up deciding to head over and see what we could find.</p>

    <p>Coming out of the cafe, the rain had decided to double down and come down harder and harder. That definitely wasn't the desired result, but Mother Nature is like the Honey Badger - she doesn't give a shit. Rather than sticking with the plan of walking over and getting soaked, we lucked out with a train stop right next to the cafe, so we jumped in to at least save a few feet of walking.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/79KnPpxh.jpg" alt="Coming out of the Cafe"></img>

    <p>Now Zack and I are pretty hearty, seasoned, and experienced travelers. I'm not sure how this came to be, but we got totally turned around by the Porto Metro ticket machine. We tried to figure out how many zones we wanted to travel, what the cost would be, but their setup was nothing but gibberish for a good 5 minutes. Despite the initial confusion, we slowly pieced together what we thought we needed, then got our tickets and were on our way.</p>

    <p>The cool part about opting for the train was that the route took us right over that giant bridge. Even through the clouds and rain we got some great views down the river and over town. But right after crossing the bridge, we were off the train and back out in the rain. Although it said it was going to be a short-ish walk to the museums, the rain was absolutely unforgiving. Off we trudged.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FHbOpYah.jpg" alt="The Bridge over Duoro"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/p4ghW4hh.jpg" alt="Porto on the Duoro"></img>

    <p>Small alleys, staircases, having to look at the map a couple times, and more rain, but we kept our heads down and hoods up as we plodded on. Despite the weather, the route we took was quite pretty. No lie (this feeling would hold true throughout the country), the amount of small alleyways is insane. And the crazy part, they're all picturesque and pretty in their own right. So even though we were soaked, it was a delightful (in hindsight) walk over. Eventually, we made it to the World of Wine complex, and had a good half a second to dry off before getting our vaccination status checked.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/1WNZN8Jh.jpg" alt="Attack of the Artwork"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZFpFZ2zh.jpg" alt="Wet Zack a Walking"></img>

    <p>Luckily enough, we'd stumbled upon quite the complex. As we'd learn, World of Wine is part of one of the big Port Wine conglomerates in Porto, and they put this incredible complex together to celebrate (and monetize) all things wine. Our first wonderful stop in this little heaven out of the rain - The Cork Museum!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/jRjjyFRh.jpg" alt="Planet Cork"></img>

    <p>I had a decent precursory knowledge of cork before this, but Planet Cork really blew me away. I can't fully recall all of the cool facts I learned about this incredible material, but here are a few: when compressed it returns to its orignal shape, it's hypoallergenic, impermeable to liquids an gases (hence used as a wine cork!), fire retardant, and so much more!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/2V9xH5Oh.jpg" alt="Cork Under Pressure"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MtgGACTh.jpg" alt="Benefits of Cork"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/DK58b5jh.jpg" alt="Portugal - 49.6%"></img>

    <p>The first section was all about sharing the gospel, properties, background, and general information about the cork tree. Again, really an impressive material and plant! Then, as you moved along, it transferred to more information about the growth and harvest of the tree, then moved into the processing, production, and usage of cork in general. Cool fun quick facts: it's only after about 43 years that the cork tree's harvest reaches wine-cork level quality, and cork is used for pretty much everything. They had a display of cork used in an engine block, but I'm calling bullshit on that...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/4FMgVFEh.jpg" alt="A Cork Harvest Hallway"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uDYcljUh.jpg" alt="Cork Engine Block"></img>

    <p>In all, a REALLY cool museum, and as maybe weird as it sounds, I gained a clear new respect and awe for this pretty incredible material.</p>

    <p>Whoever designed the layout did it pretty well, as the route ended up in the gift shop. Right beforehand, Zack had a cheeky grin on his face, and ended up surprising me with my own cork! There was a little machine somewhere along the way, and he got my name lasered onto one. What a dude! Well we perused through the gift shop, got a couple things, then were off and back to the main complex to head to the next museum.</p>

    <p>It took us a weird while to find it, but we eventually rolled up to The Bridge Collection. A bit of a non-descript name, but it's essentially a museum of drinking vessels. They claim to have something ~9000 years old, so we were intrigued to see what was inside.</p>

    <p>Right at the beginning of the progression was the oldest vessel. And right next to that was a special display where some prominent dude (I couldn't decide if he was the benefactor (aka Bridge) or just some historian of sorts), but he was highlighting the piece of the month. Well, we kinda came to the conclusion that he's essentially a private collector/benefactor, and must be one rich son of a gun.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/tfTz1UBh.jpg" alt="Bridge Collection"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eDe4yzZh.jpg" alt="Over 9000 years old"></img>

    <p>I was a little bit museum'd out by that point, so the reading became less prevalent and just became more of a stroll looking at a ton of glasses, cups, chalices, vessels, and more. A few of the highlights were a cup potentially used by Alexander the Great, a Das Boot, a cool Rams Head cup, and a good number of other things. Tons of cool items to take a look at, and we slowly strolled on through and eventually headed out.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/gJnn9B4h.jpg" alt="Alexander's Cup"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/SPv3d2Rh.jpg" alt="Tall Martini Glass"></img>

    <p>Once we were done and out of the Bridge Collection, we wandered out and found a pretty big inside courtyard with a few tables. Perfect spot for a little break. Both of us hit the loo and then we took some time to gather our thoughts, take a break, and set our sights on food and wine. We were ready for a little fill up, and that plan was going to take us towards the waterfront to see what we could find.</p>

    <p>After our relaxing little break and some high quality break time, we were back on our feet and headed off. Right as we got out of the buidling and were coming down the stairs back to the alley-level, we were struck by some loud music, and stumbled upon a pop-up brass band playing outside of the chocolate shop! Hot damn! I love me some good music.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QCenIfMh.jpg" alt="Pop-Up Brass"></img>

    <p>As soon as we dove into the tiny alley, the band was on the move and gave us a little musical wave. But we continued our way down another picturesque tiny street, enjoyed the stonework, and eventually made our way down to the waterfront.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/o5mrikRh.jpg" alt="Tiny Alley"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5R8bG0oh.jpg" alt="Tire Spectrum"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vForGWEh.jpg" alt="Waterfront Walkway"></img>

    <p>We were now faced with a plethora of eatery options. But as luck would have it, we walked right by a little Mercado and opted to pop in. Definitely the right choice. Mercados are such an awesome and enjoyable concept. Think of it as in a closed food truck court, with the same idea - tons of eateries with lots of variety, but this place had alcohol and tons of delicious options. Honestly, too many.</p>

    <p>After perusing all of the options, I settled on some seafood and rice and some wine. My mind was set on seafood for the whole trip, and this was the starting block. Wanna know what's awesome? A full glass of wine only cost 2€, and that was some damn good wine. Man I love this place. The seafood mix was delicious, the wine was rich, and it was a great spot to food up, wine up, and in the process we scribbled up a rough plan for the rest of our trip. Well. Oiled. Machine.</p>

    <p>With our vittles all polished off, we were back out on the waterfront. It was a nice stroll with the new subdued rain, and there was a lot to peruse and watch as we walked along. At some point we encountered a pretty ornate looking building with some organ music emanating out, so we decided to jump in.</p>

    <p>Well, turned out to be a pretty clear tourist trap, but I didn't realize that until I'd ordered a snack. Despite the trap feeling, their schtick was deep-fried cod fish bakes, and hot damn they were pretty delicious. I got sucked into "The Portugal Experience", but the combo of some white port wine and the little codfish bake was actually quite delicious. With that in hand, Zack and I found a spot to sit on the top veranda to people watch, chat, snack, and keep and eye on the organ player who really didn't want to be there.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/j3PPTFmh.jpg" alt="The Checkout Line"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/effcwToh.jpg" alt="View from the Top"></img>

    <p>Once the snacking was done, we moved back out to the waterfront and continued our stroll back towards the big bridge. Since we were in Porto, the topic of Port Wine was pretty consistently on our minds. Thinking back to our overlook from the early morning, we saw a number of clear names on some rows of buildings, and we accurately predicted that those were Port Wine Cellars. Well, since we were still meandering and now a little thirsty, we set our minds on seeing if we could snag a tour through one of the cellars.</p>

    <p>We were near the end of the waterfront drag, and Cálem Cellars was right there, so we popped in. Well would you believe our luck. We asked if they had a tour available, and we were immediately ushered to the english-speaking tour that started not 5 minutes ago. Hot damn! We paid and got settled up and were escorted to the group to join in on the tour.</p>

    <p>The further the tour went along, the more and more I felt the similarities between a Port Wine Cellar and Whiskey Distillery tour, and similar in terms of process, setup, and such. But we were led through the process by our frank and funny guide Leonardo and learned a lot of how this all goes down.</p>

    <p>The river Duoro, the one that goes right through Porto, is home to a large swath of renowned wine production. Not in town, but if you go up river a hundred miles or so, the rolling hills and plains are world renowned as a fertile and high-quality region for grape growing. Those grapes are turned into wine, and some of that wine is then used to make Port wine!</p>

    <p>Rather than a comprehensive dialogue, here are some of the notes that I took from our tour at Cálem:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Just like whiskey, Port must be aged a minimum of 3 years</li>
      <li>There's a similar setup/offering to cask strength, but for Port it's called Vintage. As luck would have it, 1990 was a good year for Vintage. I know ;-)</li>
      <li>The aging of Port is only counted when its in a barrel, vats don't count towards the years of aging</li>
      <li>Color change during maturation is also similar to whiskey - white wines gain a redder color from the barrels, and red wines lose color to the barrels</li>
      <li>Most Port that you find is a blend</li>
      <li>Blends don't age once they're in the bottle - a 10yr blend will stay 10yr regardless of when you end up popping it. And, those bottles can stay open for a long while without going bad</li>
      <li>Vintages, on the other hand, are alive, in a way. Once Vintage Ports are bottled, they will still age and mature in the bottle, and need to be stored sideways. Once they're opened, they need to be filtered (or decanted, we got conflicting info on that point) and drank within a few days</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Leonardo ended up being a really unique and snarky tour guide in pretty fun way. He cracked a bunch of joikes, seemed a bit hands-off/sour towards the company ("This is a triangle hierarcy, and I'm not even on it"), and didn't seem to like port wine all that much, but provided a bunch of good insight and a very interesting personality. He walked us through the intro at the process clarification with a bunch of background information, then to the maturation warehouse (those are some HUGE vats), and then eventually up to the tasting.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FFxYaibh.jpg" alt="Leonardo next to a Big Vat - Courtesy of Zack Herhold"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/oXIfNDrh.jpg" alt="That's a Lot of Bottles - Courtesy of Zack Herhold"></img>

    <p>The tasting consisted of a White, a Tawny, and a Vintage. Leonardo walked us through the tastes, we had a couple good laughs, got to know the folks sitting next to us, and enjoyed the sips. I wasn't a huge fan of the white, but the vintage and tawny ended up being pretty good. Eventually Leo left us, and we were left to finish our tastings to our own devices. Once we were all done with our glasses, it was back out and into the world. For me, a really cool and interesting first exposure to the world and taste of Port wine!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/kewqcBFh.jpg" alt="Zack at the Tasting"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5acAVZJh.jpg" alt="Bottles to Oblivion"></img>

    <p>From Cálem we kinda rushed out of there as we had a scheduled event to make - a Zoom Call with the CBYX crew! Since we were still on the other side of town, we had to make our way along the waterfront, up a labyrinth of sidewalks and staircases and tiny roads to get back up to the train stop, and from there were able to head back to the hotel. We made somewhat light work of the walk up the hill in the misty rain, and before you knew it, we were back at the hostel.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/QkuMyRYh.jpg" alt="A Spooky Staircase"></img><br>

    <p>Although we were super stoked to chat with our CBYX crew, being in a hostel made that a little bit weird, and frustratingly difficult. To start, there was someone in our room, so we couldn't do it in there. Next, the wifi was super spotty, then the common room was packed, so we were kinda relegated to the stairwell. Then, there was a lady yelling at the top of the staircase and things were a bit chaotic. Despite all that, what a pleasure it was to see and 'talk' with everyone! No joke, we are so lucky to have such a great group of people that has stayed in contact since the program ended, and I'm pretty lucky to have all of them still in my life.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">I've kinda become used to it, but it's still a bummer every time. The entirety of the chat, it felt like we were on a 10-20 second lag from the rest of the conversation. I know it's nuts to be able to talk with people halfway across the world, but the choppiness and delay really makes it hard, and makes the distance that much more difficult to deal with.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/3EzVvbWh.jpg" alt="Christmas Call in the Stairwell"></img>

    <p>After we wrapped up the laughs and reunion with the CBYX gang, it was back out on the town for a night cap (and maybe some food). We had no goals or targets in our sights, just some mild wandering to see what would come up, a strategy that's proven successful for us in the past. After a quick peek for a general direction and randomly walking down a dead-end of an alley, we motored on and stubmled into what looked like a pretty trendy spot, and had one thing on our mind - Porto Tonics. (think Gin & Tonic but with port wine)</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/56r906Lh.jpg" alt="Dead End"></img>

    <p>Turns out with nailed it. This place was deeeeeelicious. First up were our Port Tonics, and that is quite the ingenious creation. White Port with Tonic and an Orange in it, those were extremely refreshing and delicious. Then came the cheese board. Faaaaantastic. We had quite the time at that little trendy bar with our great food, drink and conversation, and then once we polished off our second Port Tonics, we were back out and wandering.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/nREa824h.jpg" alt="Port Tonics and Cheese"></img>

    <p>The wandering continued until Zack saw something he couldn't pass up just by the name alone. So we popped into Bonaparte and he was automatically in proverbial heaven. A low-lighted bar with tons of shit on the walls, it ended up being a pretty chill place to hang out and have a drink. Zack was honestly in hog heaven. He spent a good portion of the time talking about how he wanted to try and sneak a trinket or relic on the wall without anyone noticing. Then, coming back years later, it'd still be on the wall. That'd honestly be a pretty cool achievement.</p>

    <p>Amidst the good conversation and good vibes, we got in a couple rounds of backgammon with our drinks. During our segments of people watching, it looked like it was all dudes on dates in the place, but whatever, it was Sunday night in a pretty cool spot. Kinda par for the course. After we finished our second drink, we were unsure what to do, but after taking a look on the map, I convinced Zack to tag along for one last drink to end the night.</p>

    <p>The brewery I'd seen on the map nearby was the target, but as we walked up it was very evident that it was closed. What the hell. Thankfully, and weirdly, enough, the comic shop next to it was open and looked to be a pretty decent night owl bar. It was a really unique setup, but we snagged our beers and then a table out on the sidewalk. Good chats about finance, family, politics, the world, and more followed.</p>

    <p>Once we finished that beer up, Zack was dead set on the cups we had, and somehow a few hours later they were sitting in his bags. Funny how that happens. But we were up and at 'em and headed back to the hostel. Along the way we stumbled upon a WWI memorial. The Iron Cross at the top had us questioning where Portugal played in that chaos, but unfortunately we left without answers.</p>

    <p>Right before we made it back to the hostel, we saw a recommendation that Leonardo had shared on the Cálem tour. We were luckily enough staying near to the supposedly most beautiful McDonalds in the world. Naturally, with that kind of hyperbole, we had to check it out. It was definitely an ornate interior, and I don't know if I can rate it as best in the world, but it was pretty. And sure enough, the double cheeseburger still tasted like McDonalds.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uAtymTGh.jpg" alt="Chandelier'd Fast Food"></img>

    <p>With our fast food fix and our great night of drinking, wandering, and chatting, we'd made it back to the hostel. After some note taking, it was time to hit the sack.</p>

    <h2 id="Day4">Day 4 - Self-Guided Porto Explorathon</h2>

    <p>Following the same routine as the day before, we got up and ready and were back out on the town. This time, the skies weren't full of water! Hot damn!!! And my camera was back in working order to boot! With that, we were off and walkign, and opted on a self-guided tour through town to enjoy the various areas of town.</p>

    <p>Our tour led us through the part we saw the day before, then a little further to a pretty non-toursity part. A fairly low-key amount of activity as people were out and about in their daily lives, and we got to walk and explore amongst it all. From those non-touristy areas we explored, a really interesting vibe came about. From my subjective perspective, Portugal is not a developing country, but not a fully developed one either. There was an interesting mix of run-down and abandoned stuff that kinda reminded me of exploring through Cuba, but then a mix of super modern and new stuff which makes you think of Western Europe.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/wHA2GAFh.jpg" alt="Hushed Shopping Street"></img>

    <p>The route we took weaved us through a shopping area that was just waking up, a couple residential streets, by a big hospital, and all around. We explored and enjoyed the various sights we saw going up and down the hills and through some gardens and tight alleyways and a bunch more.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vbwDAz9h.jpg" alt="Quiet Street going Down"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/9DZbZjOh.jpg" alt="Another Quiet Alley"></img>

    <p>Porto is an extremely hilly town, and we were able to experience that in full force not just in the morning, but throughout the full day. Eventually the ups and downs resulted in us being right next to the river, where we then turned back around and headed uphill to return back to the overlook from the day before. It took us a little bit of effort to head back up the hill, but we eventually made it back to the butcher man painted on the corner and the great sights over town.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UHTEihfh.jpg" alt="Colorful Apartments"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yzOUB3Yh.jpg" alt="Colorful Buildings and Orange Rooves"></img>

    <p>We took our time to take in the sights now in the mist instead of the rain, and were again enjoying how diverse/variable Porto is. The next portion of our self-guided tour was to head not straight down to the waterfront, but to put together a nice weave through the many areas below the lookout and see what we stumble upon.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/gXz2QiDh.jpg" alt="Stair Climbers"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VvyBW2Ph.jpg" alt="Hey Zack!"></img>

    <p>Once again the strategic wandering turned out to be a great idea. Yet more and more beautiful little alleyways (with a few close calls between us and faster-than-anticipated cars) and streets and squares. There were a number of UNESCO buildings and plaques we stumbled upon, so it was nice to read up on those as well while we were exploring. The wandering loop eventually plopped us back onto the square with the giant Henry the Navigator statue. We toyed with going into the castle/palace that was right on the square, but opted not to spend the high admission price, and just walked around the square for a bit admiring the statue and enjoying the nice colors on display.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/w37wYARh.jpg" alt="Tight Y Intersection"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/PKxGJRbh.jpg" alt="Lion Roars"></img>

    <p>After we made a lap around the statue and were wandering up to the big warehouse-looking building to see if it was another Mercado or something, we ran across the folks we met from the Cálem tour the day before. We had a quick chat about what we were all up to, and they suggested we head over to the big cathedral on the hill next. So, that's what we did.</p>

    <p>The walk over to that was a good bit of uphill, but fairly enjoyable through more quaint and quite streets and alleys. Once we got a little closer, essentially right under the church retaining walls, it got a bit weird. There were some folks off on a corner of the staircase smoking something, but we did our best to pay no mind, head up the staircase, and get to where we were going.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/aW7n4f6h.jpg" alt="See and Hear No Evil"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vu2Uxgnh.jpg" alt="The Church from Below"></img>

    <p>The short hike up the stairs transported us to a much more lively, and much more scenic spot. The church had a pretty prominent spot up on the tallest hill of town overlooking the whole city. Amazing how religion had that much sway back in the day... But the plaza in front of the church was a gorgeous spot. We wandered around, got some pictures and sights of the town from that vantage point, then wandered over to the church itself.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/C8fQfkmh.jpg" alt="Far Off Church"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/JMQbvolh.jpg" alt="Pillar and View"></img>

    <p>We paid our entrance and then started our wandering. Right after the entrance, something reeked of rotten spaghetti, so that sped things up past that horrid stench. Once we got past that, we perused the halls for a bit, but then made our way to the tower.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/JLXpGk6h.jpg" alt="Blue Tile and Church Archway"></img>

    <p>It's always cool to see how worn-down stone can become after centuries of use, and we added to that usage as we wound our way up to the lookout on the tower. As we expected, we got some gorgeous views from the tower, even with the high winds blowing us around left and right. I took my time, got some time to enjoy the city on each side of the tower, and continued to grow my appreciation and interest in this cool city on the Duoro.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/WFSt11Ih.jpg" alt="Blue Tile and Orange Roof"></img>

    <p>After a good bit of time up top, we wound our way back down the stairs and into the church courtyard. There were some beautiful walls of blue tile artwork on the upper courtyard to admire, and we did as such. Then, continuing on the designated route through the grounds, we ended up in the massive chapel. Once we'd checked that out though, we were all set and continued on. Sounds arrogant, but gigantic churchs, castles, etc. start to blend together after a while. Each is beautiful and masterful in their own right, but I'm not enthused enough by them for each one to draw my attention for too long.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/S4sijfoh.jpg" alt="Zack and Tile"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/b6pROn0h.jpg" alt="Gigantic Cathedral"></img>

    <p>Right about that time, our internal clocks were yelling for some coffee. Once again, we were in a bit of a dead zone, but after the ordeal from the day before, I had spotted a specialty coffee shop just down the hill from where we were at, so we headed that way.</p>

    <p>It was a bit of a roundabout way down there, having to backtrack a bit then loop around, but the route gave us a chance to see some new things and more cool parts of town. Down near the river we got to walk through a long tunnel and saw some more of the millions of runners that inhabit Portugal. Then, finding the staircase that headed up to the cafe, we got some more views of the town, river, and the many colorful buildings all around.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FCCkutJh.jpg" alt="The Elevator to Town"></img>

    <p>Luckily enough, we got to the cafe just in time to snag the last table outside and had a good view of things to enjoy while we were hanging out. After some questioning where to order, we walked up to the counter of the one-man operation and put in our requests. After a hot second our stuff came out, and the delicious croissant with nutella, and weird coffe-like liquid were perfect bits to enjoy with the view. Sitting there, under the shaded sunlight, with plenty of people- and city-watching at hand, we enjoyed our quaint and relaxing little break to enjoy the city and recoup some energy.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ykE2MFGh.jpg" alt="View from the Cafe"></img>

    <p>We took our time with our food and coffee and let the morning roll by for a bit. But once we were set, we squared up with the coffee guy and headed up the staircase back towards town. This little stretch was a good example of it, but it was surprising to see how many places, buildings, and lots were either abandoned, empty, or under construction. Seemed to be a pretty common setup/issue, but a potential reason as to why was not blatantly clear. As soon as you got off the main tourist drag, this was pretty evident, and added to the vibe of Portugal kinda being a not-developed and not-developing country.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/lQHxAnEh.jpg" alt="Up the Stairs"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VsEV8gWh.jpg" alt="Abandoned Lot"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/3fHrvnwh.jpg" alt="Butcher on the Wall"></img>

    <p>The walkway eventually got us up the hill and to where we wanted. Next stop - the top deck of the bridge! Holy wind, Batman. But at the same time, Holy Views as well!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UmCzg2Zh.jpg" alt="Above the Deck, Down the Line"></img>

    <p>The jaunt across the top deck of the Ponte Luis bridge was really gorgeous. The winds were blowing really strong, so it was honestly a little bit sketchy with the low railings and only bollards between the walkway and the train tracks. But veiled sunlight was coming in and out of view and having some clear views of the hilly, unique, and tiered town made me really happy.</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Quick Thought</strong>:  there's no way a bridge like this would be allowed in the US. For the trains, there'd be a required fence between the train tracks and the trains so people don't run across the tracks. Then, on the edges of the decks, the fences would be 10' high so people don't jump. No joke, it was nice having less restrictive and enclosed architecture to enjoy the freedom of movement and unosbstructed or blocked views. Go Europe.</p>

    <p>High winds and sketchy railings be damned, Zack and I had a nice jaunt across the bridge and made it successfully to the other side. As soon as we crossed, we pulled off to the lookout above the river to enjoy the city again from that viewpoint (now with no rain!). Continuing on, we headed up the street a little bit to go check out the fortress above the roadway.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/YEC4GA4h.jpg" alt="Zack and I after the Bridge - Courtesy of Zack Herhold"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/weO1PHeh.jpg" alt="Perspective Down the Tracks to Town"></img>

    <p>Heading towards the fortress, we were looking forward to some military history, some old stories of who sieged upon whom in Porto, and cool artefacts to get a feel of how Portugal has evolved militarily through the ages. Well, those hopes came crashing down pretty quickly. The road up to the fortress was fairly straight and singular, but then at the fortress, it was just an empty plaza in front of a big cylindrical tower, and that all was next to a very clearly zoned and fenced area with explicit signs to keep out of an active military area.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/rdQk66uh.jpg" alt="Entry to the Fortress"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/qyvCFJQh.jpg" alt="Plaza where they Meet"></img><br>

    Needless to say, the lack of any kind of information (even to the point of why or how this place is considered a fortress), was a bit of a disappointment. Zack and I though, being seasoned professionals, didn't let this get to us too long, as there were still some beautiful views to enjoy from yet another overlook over the city. We hung around long enough to watch a couple trains cross the bridge, get another great pic of us, and enjoy some more sunlight. But from there, it was back to exploring.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/oO8ovTkh.jpg" alt="Train Crossing"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/mb2NZnDh.jpg" alt="River Houses"></img>

    <p>From there, we needed to find a bathroom. Although it was still a walk away, Zack totally had his sights set on the pristine public toilets of the World of Wine complex. I was noncommittal and open to new public toilet experiences, but him, not so much. We had some funny banter over that and I learned about George's schtick on public toilets from Seinfeld (I should really watch that show sometime...), and eventually we were on our way back to WOW.</p>

    <p>Goal in mind we were off and walking. This time though, we took a different route than the day before, and had some fun things to view and chat about along the way. Like what I mentioned before, there is such a random mixture of well-off and developed buildings next to drab, abandoned, or empty buildings. That juxtaposition is something really interesting to see, especially so frequently.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xmRJ7zRh.jpg" alt="Quiet Rundown Roadway"></img>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Quick Thought</strong>:  one thing we saw all over the place, due to it being Christmas time, were Santa figurines hanging from windows and balconies and such. Initially it didn't make sense. But, after thinking about it, it totally does. Most apartments and buildings don't have chimneys, so how's Santa going to get in? Through the window or the balcony!!!</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Cultural Comment</strong>: Zack made a really good observation and comparison of Portugal to East Germany developing after reunification. Portugal has been been a democracy since the mid-'70's, and it was pretty visible that some things were still being built up. It's a fully functional and successful country, but still in terms of development, the comparison seems to fit.</p>

    <p>After weaving our way through some new, quiet, and pretty streets, we wound up back at the big complex for a potty break. I'll give it to Zack, it was a nice place to hit the loo and take a break. We spent a bit of time sitting at the tables inside to rest the legs for a hot minute, but then were back off and walking, now further down the hillside on that side of the river.</p>

    <p>Back off and running, we had a general direction in mind, but found ourselves and extended/scenic route to enjoy it for a little longer. That route weaved us past the touristy/developed area (not before stopping in a couple stores), and through a pretty empty and undeveloped part of the cellar district. It wasn't run down, just not all glitzed and glamoured up. Pretty quiet, apparently pretty historic, and a low-key atmosphere for us to walk around and enjoy.</p>

    <p>Having wandered a little farther than we thought, we took a right and started to head back down towards the waterfront. The journey was a little weird at parts, having to go through an abandoned parking lot, then through a really tight-knit group of homes with a couple dogs barking, but we made our way through and eventually stumbled upon the Ferreira gift shop. We walked in, perused the offerings, then asked the guy about a tour. Well, once again just our luck, the next English tour started in 6 minutes down at the visitors center! We thanked him profusely, got our hustle on, braved the super tight and small streets with cars right next to your hip, and made it down in time to start. What incredible and perfect timing to join in on another tour!</p>

    <p>We only had a couple minutes to wander around the big room (where in-barrel maturation used to take place) before our tour guide rounded up her sheep and we got underway. A different vibe than the day before, our tour guide was super knowledgable, informative, and had a big crowd to work with as we wound our way through the giant complex that is Ferreira.</p>

    <p>The Spark Notes of our awesome tour through Ferreira:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Established in 1751 - that's pretty old</li>
      <li>Still Portuguese-owned, but now part of a small conglomerate of Portuguese-owned port makers</li>
      <li>A massive operation, vats and barrels were staged and in use everywhere</li>
      <li>No shade on Leo from Cálem, but our tour guide shared a ton of interesting info, direct, and covered all topics along the line from grape to bottle</li>
      <li>She provided a description of how the grapes and wine went from the harvest in the Duoro Valley (quite the action in and of itself), to being transported in barrels on tiny boats all the way to Porto</li>
      <li>Dona Antonia was the matriarch of the family business, who jumped in around the third generation to keep the whole thing afloat. She became quite the benefactor and is responsible for Ferreira still being around</li>
      <li>Ferreira slowly took over an entire area of the city where their cellar and maturation houses are. From one congregation spot, our guide stopped us and said the walkway we're going up next used to be an actual city road. But since the place grew so big, they gobbled up whole city blocks for their use</li>
      <li>A walk through the vintage hall showed the history of their product. The oldest vintage we saw was from 1815, and there were new vintages every few years since then</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After the informative and windy tour through the cellars, we were popped back out onto the road and back into the gift shop from earlier. On to the tasting! Ferreira put on quite the good show with 5 different ports to try - white, ruby, tawny, and older tawny, then a vintage tawny. Zack and I got into an analytical mode to see which one we liked best. I can't remember specifically, but Zack wasn't a big fan of the tawnies - too different for him. For me, on the other hand, the tawnies were my favorites, I think the old tawny specifically. Overall, some really good ports (as far as my taste-bud knowledge of ports goes).</p>

    <p>For those in the know will notice something weird about this picture. Zack tried to use it as a loophole of getting around the penalty. I was nice enough to not call him out on it (the whole trip), but as you can see, he was not abiding by the rules of spirit of the game. Booo Zack, Boooooooo.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CkihIZWh.jpg" alt="Zack. Lame."></img>

    <p>Through the great tastings and good discussions, we even had some brief mini-conversations with the Dutch couple sitting next to us. They were nice and friendly, but interactions were brief as we worked our way through the liquid tour. After we finished our glasses, gave a final decision of what our favorites were, we were back off and running. Thanks to Ferreira for a great little tour!</p>

    <p>Weaving back down the narrowing street, we worked our way down towards the waterfront. The natural decision would've been to turn right, but I was not feeling ready to dive back into the world yet, and pushed to turn left. Zack played along so we headed away from the main part of town and out along the road following the river. Zack got the bonus of seeing his beloved home town('s name) plastered on a new building, and we both got to enjoy a low-key boat yard and a little bit of activity in the mid-afternoon.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QkmUVulh.jpg" alt="San Jose Herhold"></img>

    <p>Rather than making a big loop of it (that would've taken forever), we stumbled upon a bit of a landing and just plopped down on the overhang. Not gonna lie, might've been my favorite part of Porto. We were outside of the normal hubub, but could see it all right out in front of us. The little patio was right over the river, and right at a bend, so we could see the majority of Porto straight ahead.</p>

    <img class="pano" src="https://i.imgur.com/mp5DqV3h.jpg" alt="Patio Overlook"></img>

    <p>It was calm, quiet, relaxing, and a great place to stop off. We were sitting there, chatting and taking in the city, and all of a sudden cute little stray dog came along. Full of trepid energy but a beaming smile, I gave him a nice pet before he was on his way. Although I'm always one to sit and enjoy spots like that forever, eventually it was back up and off to the races.</p>

    <p>Back on our legs we took the short stroll back over to the waterfront area. By that time, we were getting a little snacky, and conveniently enough, we knew there was a fantastic Mercado nearby. Easy solution if you ask me.












<img class="horz" src="" alt=""></img><br>

      	• Back up and walking, headed over to the Mercado again for some snacks and wine. Cute gal behind the bruschetta counter
      	• Wine in hand and delicious snacks, we mapped out our trip, working back from Zack’s flight out. Put together a pretty good game plan
      	• Fueled up anf moving, walked down the promenade and crossed the bridge back to the other side. Then we were a bit split. Zack was up for a Porto tonic but I was looking for food
      	• We stumbled upon a few places, none fit the bill, and ended up back at the hostel. Dropped my pack and we adjusted and aligned our game plan
      	• Back out and on the hunt for food. Headed to Chama to see what’s possible
      	• Got there with one couple waiting outside, then shortly thereafter it was about 10 couples that all showed up in a blink of an eye
      	• After watching the folks inside nearly duke it out in a presumed heated discussion, one dude came out and was super bubbly
      	• Unfortunately, all booked out. Bummer too, because it would’ve been a specially created 12-course meal. They’re booked out past New Years, so that wasn’t happening. Damn.
      	• Back off and walking, hoping to stumble upon something. We didn’t, and ended up back at Bonaparte
      	• Not the foodiest place ever, and not the veggie friendliest place ever either. Zack, after asking what veggie options they

      	• I struggle with saying no or approaching a potential conflict. Didn’t want to go back to zacks favorite bar, but before didn’t want to say I wanted to head for food rather than a drink
      	• Food at Bonaparte. It was ok. But struck up a conversation with some folks next to us. Daniel from San Diego and Anja from Portugal. Super friendly folks!

      2021.12.28
      	• Up and at em, another nice breakfast after repacking then back to Rupert
      	• It was quite the maze driving out of town, but followed along a good few of the streets we’d walked and was able to weave through some tight alleyways. Then out of town and off and running up The Valley Duoro
      	• Slowly started our trek out towards the mountains
      	• Started out kinda low and through a bunch of small towns. But slowly the road worked it’s way out and started climbing up and down the valley
      	• Towns became more sparse and the turns wee constant
      	• Crossing the Duoro Zack spotted a really stark statue on the side so we pulled off and down to check it out. No sign, no writing or clarification of what it was. But a really cool statue in a cool point overlooking the river and a few bridges
      	• Pushing on, we motored onto N222, which after Zack did some research, has been labeled by some as the most beautiful drive in the world. It is cal the Romanic route (Rua do Românica) after all
      	• Continued curves and ups and downs, and beautiful sights overlooking the valley
      	• At some ooont we hit a junction and then saw a grocery store to pop in. Snap idea- time for a picnic
      	• After a world-renowned nieman Marcus cookie, we dove in. Cheese and bead (chorizo for me) and taking a look at the wine offerings in wine country. Damn. Good variety and cheap prices. Can’t beat that!
      	• Got our stuff and drove down the road a bit to an overlook I found on the map.
      	• Wasn’t an overlook but merely the entrance to a driveway. It did have a beautiful view over the valley though, so we plopped and got to snacking
      	• Delicious cheese, warm bread, and some really unique chorizo. What a killer combo
      	• After that, we were maybe a little or more than half way through the valley section we planned to drive, anf continued on.
      	• Incredible views around every turn in the valley. Large hillsides with homes and towns dotted throughout. Beautiful range of colors with thr fall colors of thr trees and greens and some bright homes. Further up The Valley an increase in the number of vineyards on the hillsides. Beautiful views and so many layers of hills. The curvy road added to thr fun of thr drive and beauty of the ride
      	• Pushed further and the hillside became more and more covered with vineyards. All up and down the hillside, with tons of incredible homes and villas to accent the vines
      	• Stopped for a couple pictures, then headed up and out for a view, but the road curved around and gave us some cool shots down further the valley.
      	• What a beautiful drive. Not sure I’d say most beautiful in the world, but incredible landscapes and a fun road, it made for a beautiful adventure along the Duoro valley
      	• That road continued on and got all kinds of steep. No problem for Rupert though, he’s a beast
      	• Up and over the ridge, along some more beautiful homes and vineyards and eventually we pulled into Legamo
      	• Legamo - super nice guy at the castle. Told us a bit about the lack of documentation of the first king, but welcoming and helpful, great English
      	• Explored the castle a good bit, no access to the top of the tower, but a great spot to get a wonderful view of the town and The Valley. Beautiful little mountain town
      	• Leaving, asked the guy at the castle for a café recommendation and followed it. Took the long way out of the castle and we’re again astounded by the tiny alleyways
      	• Walked past the café and Zack noticed it. Walked in and the guy said no, they close in half an hour. No food. But we only wanted coffee so he was cool with it
      	• Cleaned table and sat down. Super friendly dude. Offered coffee or Portuguese coffee (aka espresso) and brought them out, then gave us some history of thr phone call timer on the wall. Cool stuff and super friendly guy
      	• Paolo came back another time, and when we asked to pay, he refused and eas super gracious. Couldn’t let that stand, but appreciated the wonderful and friendly attitude and were off.
      	• Back to the car and headed towards Coimbra
      	• Quite the cool little town, a little interesting getting out of it. But now on the highway and headed south
      	• Drive continued through some mountains and pretty landscapes, and I got some research on lodging, some writing and documentation, and some other stuff done as Zack commanded the boat. We’ve been listening to Shadow Divers, and got to the point where they solved the mystery
      	• Soon enough, we were rolling into Coimbra
      	• Found a janky place to park for the time being and went to check in
      	• Had to do a self-test on site to check in, and that was surprising, but lucky we have a ton
      	• While doing that, went and grabbed the car, and long story short we were checked in. Lounged a bit in the room to take a load off and made a reservation for dinner
      	• With plenty of time to spare, we got up and active and headed to town to walk around and get our feet and bearings under us
      	• Cool tightly-packed market area downtown, and lots of random shops, including a number of fabric shops. Know that would be cool for mom to glance into



      2021.12.29
      	• Beautiful stroll around Coimbra for the morning
      	• Fiest stop café for breakfast. Super yummy chocolate croissant, different dough, seemed more eggy
      	• Up the hill to the university perched above town. Really cool spot with some super old university building, some communist-ish statue, and some grat views over town
      	• Tried to get into some buildings, no dice
      	• Wandered down the hill and through the gigantic botanical gardens. Massive and super diverse
      	• Back through town up some cool streets (which is most) and back to the car
      	• Off and running, direction Nazare
      	• The beauty of those highway signs with attractions - Roman ruins nearby. Spilt second judgement, audible and headed that way
      	• We’ll fuck you Google, had us routed directly through the ruins. What the fuck
      	• Parked and paid and then had to go move the car after a security guard chased us down to tell us
      	• Totally awesome ruins
      	• How does something like this a) get abandoned and b) be rediscovered?

      	• On the road and headed to Nazare. Only about an hour, Zack was clocked out for most of it
      	• Rolled into town anf wow, what an awesome spot!!! Beach town tucked in a big bay with some insane cliffs right on the side. Place was hopping with life and we struggled to find a parking spot
      	• Got one and walked down to the beachfront, stopped for coffee Automat and 7up
      	• Beach, wow. What a beautiful place! Massive beachfront, super long til you get to the water. Stopped and took some pictures of the incredible cliff side then wandered over to the funicular
      	• Next train left shortly so we jumped in line and got on
      	• Got chatted on by an old retired guy talking about my backpack, then got some recommendations from him since him and his wife had been there for a month or so
      	• Got to the top and wandered over to the view, holy hell. Gorgeous view of the whole town, and even the big hills up back behind the town
      	• Took the trail along the cliffs edge and wandered through the built up area right on the cliff til we got to the road/trail out to the lighthouse
      	• Weren’t feeling up for the whole trek, and Zack was pushing for sunset beers, so we loitered around on the cliff, enjoyed the views, then wandered back up to get some sunset beers
      	• Packed em in and headed back down to find a spot to post up
      	• Nothing like a refreshing beer and a beautiful sunset, talked about some good things as the sun went down and enjoyed the wonderful colors coming up off the water
      	• Once it was all the way down, we packed in and headed back up the cliff, through the buildings, and found the walking trail headed back down to town. As we still didn’t have a place to stay that night, we found a bench with a good view and got that squared away. Back to the car to grab what we need then off to our cut rate hotel
      	• Checked in and got a bit comfy, then off for dinner.
      	• But of a struggle as Zack’s a vegetarian and that’s unfortunately hard to find here
      	• Ended up settling on a recommendation from the old guy and headed in
      		○ There’s something about this Michelin Guide clarification. Second place in two days, and neither would be what I would peg to the Michelin category
      	• Pretty good seafood (I was just hardcore jonesing for seafood) and wine
      	• Then off to the Irish pub to watch Sporting Lisbon play
      	• The beers were deep and I got tired early, right around when SPO tied it at 1, then back to the hotel. Would learn theyd win 3-2. Never leave a game early…..
      	• Bummed we weren’t able to fit in a game at the stadium, but that’s how it goes
      	• Back at the hotel time for bed

      2021.12.30
      	• Agreed on an earlier rise that normal, so got up and showered then headed down to the boardwalk to wait for Zack
      	• Beautiful, clear, crisp morning on the water
      	• Beat the sun out and got to see the warm light drape over the cliffs as the clock ticked
      	• Olive oil, wine, and friendship - the older the better
      	• Headed to the cliffs of north shore to watch the waves and some jet skis. Cold wind, but relaxing taking in the nature, need more of that
      	• Off and running, headed toward Ericeira
      	• More tolls, but made short work of it before making an audible at Mafra
      	• Holy Batman what a huge castle/palace
      	• Used to the the National palace, but not a seat of power. Just a gigantic palace for the rich rulers
      	• Built 1700s, quasi-abandoned when the rulers fled to Brazil with all their furniture before the French descended in there
      	• Gigantic building, could easily fit an entire town in it
      	• Incredible library, super old and historic books
      	• Really cool stop, then off to ericeira
      	• Parked north side of town and walked south before finding a good bakery. Stopped in for some coffee and baked goods while listening to some horny hostel goers chat
      	• Started to read my book but was distracted. Sat around there for a while over the cliff and watching the crane move some gigantic boulders out on the jetty
      	• Then walked through the Santa Cruz like town through the shops and such before getting to the far end
      	• Got some beautiful views of the beach and then snagged some actually lunch from a kiosk
      	• Ended up posting up to eat anf take in more of the surf anf water. So nice to stop, slow down; sit, and enjoy the spot and nature. Haven’t been doing that enough this trip
      	• Really relaxing time of it
      	• Back up the coast toward the car, almost got swarmed by a giant wave
      	• Slow stroll along and eventually back to the car
      	• Tons of people out and surfing
      	• At the car, then off to Cabo da Roca. Easy anf cool drive through the dmwindy roada and Zack got another nap in
      	• Awesome spot
      	• Rolled up and luckily found a spot to park, but the wind was blowing like crazy
      	• Walked out to the monument and it was essentially there for Instagram shots. Lame
      	• But we walked around and got some beautiful views of the mighty Atlantic from the westernmost point of continental Europe
      	• We wandered one direction then the other and found a spot to sit and look out over the ocean. But the wind was howling so that didn’t last too long
      	• Back to the monument then back to the car.
      	• Hectic into Lisbon. Huge city and tons of traffic
      	• Parking expensive as shit
      	• Got checked in them drove the car out to a cheaper parking lot
      	• Ended up at a big park. Walking back to the train to get to the hotel, but first food
      	• Got a table reserved for some Indian grub, but stopped for a kiosk beer first. Always good chats and fun over drinks
      	• Then perfec time to get to the restaurant. Had to pay for a take a self test there, gah
      	• Delicious Indian food though. Dayum.
      	• Finished up and off, to the train station. Got on the platform, anf learned we were on the incorrect side. But why the fuck are their trains on the wrong sides. Who the fuck does that?
      	• Hotel, change, and off to meet a family friend, Rmily
      	• Met her and her sister at a trendy bar, anf got to finally meet her. Such a delight! Nice to chat over Portugal, Americans living abroad, life in general; and get to know someone from my hometown! Place was slow with service, but eventually paid and were off
      	• Took the walk back up and over the hill to the hotel and out for the night

      2021.12.31
      	• Getting into Lisbon, Zack pulled his red card and insisted we go in a city tour, so that’s what was planned for the day
      	• Most/all tours were three hours long, which is pretty long, but Zack nailed down one of them and we had some time to kill before then and after breakfast
      	• Ended up cruising some side streets and new areas of town in a roundabout way to the tour
      	• Checked out apparently the oldest bookstore in the world, then a hop over to the square where the tour we were planning on wasn’t there
      	• Got looped into another trout already started up and we’re in for a long ride with Fraga
      	• First was Bairro Alto - the old neighborhood, tons of bars and restaurants and a trendy place to be
      	• The Chiado, known for a drunk ‘rapper’ who set up shop in that part of town way back when. Kind of a ritzy shopping area
      	• Wandered up the hill to a big plaza and Fraga explained a few historical stories of Portugal - battle of the John’s, establishment of the giant convent on the hill (and how it destroyed and not rebuilt after the earthquake), and the story of the fall of the dictatorship
      	• Down the hill through some pretty streets to the main train station, some talking, then through the station and out onto the mainplaza in front. Really cool train station
      	• Plaza to plaza, and wandered through to an old cathedral that had burnt down and rebuilt. Crazy to see the melted stone inside
      	• Then through another square with a giant statue of a Joao, then down the main drag
      	• Along then started a convo with a friendly gal also on the trip, Daisy from The Netherlands. She was in town a little early before her friends arrived for New Years, and Zack and I got to chatting with her as we strolled down the main drag
      	• Eventually we got to a standard touristy restaurant and we had to hold up - Fraga had a surprise
      	• We loitered about and hit the loo before he brought a Pastel do Belém for everyone! A custardy cupcake type thing, and with a little cinnamon it’s absolutely delightful
      	• Zack even won a second one through some trivia. Like a boss
      	• Onward we strolled and down to the waterfront. Holy shit the main square is awesome and huge. Giant arc du Triumphe variant and gigantic plaza. Really enjoyed that square
      	• Then towards the north east towards Alfama, old moor neighborhood
      	• Started to head up the hill and through the beautiful tiny alleyways
      	• Found a plaza/staircase and got some stories from Fraga
      	• I’m June apparently every night is a party, people build little stands and it’s nothing but wine and sardines. He and his friends have a contest to see who can tear the most in a month. The record? 398. Blech
      		○ A Nossa
      		○ Ginjinha sem rival
      		○ Portugal is orange in some languages
      	• Onward and upward, such cool alleyways and beautiful buildings
      	• Cool thing in that neighborhood, a ton of the older inhabitants had been memorialized on the walls by an expat who was taken in by the neighborhood. How cool
      	• Eventually made it up to the top and the end of the tour at the chapel on the hill. Beautiful overlook, and tons of KSC stickers (weird) but we bid adieu to Fraga and got some pictures at the top
      	• Daisy, Zack and I were then on a mission to find a place to sit in the sun and get some coffee. First place would’ve been a 15min wait, screw that, so we backtracked on the tour route and made it back down close to the water to a café Zack had spotted on the way
      	• Found a great table and posted up. Coffee and charcuterie on order in the sunlight
      	• Great chats with Daisy and we learned about the Elfstedentocht, the weird anti-Santa tradition in the Netherlands, and how Gouda is pronounced chouda (she was very adamant about that), and a number of other things. She had to jet early, but got her contact info to meet up for New Years later
      	• I moved to the other side of the table to get out of staring at the sun, and then we had some wine on the way
      	• Time to start cranking on some postcards. Zack was a machine and I got underway
      	• While we were writing, the waitresses came out joking that they wanted a postcard, so I got their address and will be writing on up from home
      	• Eventually we both got our postcards written, got another glass, and then moved onto the CBYX postcards as a pair of folks from Canada came in
      	• They weren’t a full couple, but seemed to be work colleagues and that guy probably had sights set on something more. Funny to listen into the convo
      	• Eventually we cranked out our postcards and had quite the stack of them
      		○ Want a postcard on my next trip? Give me your address and let me know!
      	• Up and at em, we were off
      	• It was approaching sunset and we were in the mood for a place to watch it
      	• Not sure completely how it went down, but here’s what I remember and how we chatted it out later
      		○ I asked what we should do
      		○ Zack said head to the lookout above the city
      		○ I explained some skepticism about it (far off, likely wouldn’t make it) then said we should head back to the main square and watch from down below
      		○ Zack shit on that ideas, and I got pissed
      	• Bad mood sprung up, and to stem the discussion, flipped a coin. It ended on the waterfront so we headed that direction, wandered through the square and down to a staircase over the water to sit and watch the sun go down
      	• Beautiful sunset over the water, but clouds out over the ocean made it come a little early. Still gorgeous for sure
      	• Up and out we headed in the direction of the Mercado
      	• Welp, bummer, as you needed a test to go in, and we didn’t have one. Damnit.
      	• Out the market and what do we see? Coyo Taco. No-brainer
      	• Got in, chips and guac to start, then some burritos. Holy shit delicious. Was in absolutely hog heaven with my shrimp burrito
      	• At some point I asked Zack about the scuffle earlier to clear the air
      		○ Zack can sense I know what I want; we’re close friends
      		○ Despite that, I don’t always say what I want when asking questions or looking to make decisions
      		○ That can cause problems when what he’s looking to do doesn’t match up with what I want to do
      	• Coming out of that
      		○ Should work on clarifying what my desired and ideas are before poopooing on someone else’s
      		○ Having a bit of trouble chewing on this, as I’ve received feedback from others when I do that as it makes me come across as arrogant and controlling, not sure how I find that balance
      	• Delicious food, then off and running back towards the hotel. Started the New Years celebrations early with some beers but headed back to the hotel to fresh and rest up
      	• After a bit of a nap, got all squared up and grabbed some beers to head to the main square to meet up with Daisy and her friends
      	• With some beers in hand; we found a spot to chill out near the water and started a little reflection of the year that was and the year to come Zack asked my three resolutions
      		○ Take the first step
      		○ Gain leadership experience
      		○ Make physical activity a thing
      	• Right as I asked Zack his and he got his first one out (improve endurance race times) we got interrupted by Sahil, Harry, and Prabayat Singh and the swapping of shirts…
      	• Wed noticed that there are tons of folks with NASA swag here, and Prabat Singh was one of them
      	• The conversation started though with them offering us shots of Jameson (not the first time something like this has happened on New Years in a foreign land…)
      	• After the first shot,  shirt swap took place. Would not have anticipated such a random event. Holy shit.,.
      	• One shot turned to two, things got more crazy and boisterous, and then the third came up. Oh man, what a crazy start to the night
      	• They cut things off and wandered on, and Zack and I were laughing and surprised as we finished ours and headed out too
      	• We wandered around then headed to a kiosk to find some more beers and stock up
      		○ Lots of peddlers on the streets here
      		○ Weed? Coke? Negative Test?
      		○ Crazy what now counts for contraband…
      	• Started with some alcohol free beers as we walked back to the square
      	• We had our beers going and they rolled up. Met Daisys friends from Poland, Sylwia and Paola
      	• They were looking for a drink, but weren’t in for our cheap beers, so we headed toward the main drag and found a table open to drink our beers and for the gals to get some wine
      	• Fun chats as the gals called their families to celebrate the new year
      	• There we learned that the gals know each other through their experience in archery. All are apparently world/class, and we learned Sylwia even competed in Tokyo! Holy shit! I just met and Olympic athlete!!!
      	• Once wines were finished, we got close to the countdown and headed back towards the big main square
      	• On the way; we saw our Indian friends again and got swarmed. Definitely not social-distancing conformed, but a very energetic greeting and we eventually broke away
      	• We’d lost the gals, but we had to go piss. Got sketchy, but got away with it
      	• Met back up with the ladies then found a spot to watch the countdown (no countdown), but the intermittent yelling of the few thousand people signified the time was nigh
      		○ Funny how new regulations in pace to prevent gatherings, but a few thousand people were present regardless
      	• Eventually, on to 2022!!! Cool fireworks across rhe bay and we enjoyed the display
      	• Well we didn’t stay around too long as we walked with the gals back towards town, fun chatting with Paola (Sylwia was a bit either quiet or just up tight) as we walked
      	• At some point I learned Zack signed me on to hit a bullseye from 20ft. Said I have natural talent, Sheesh. Called him out for his class-a bullshit. I Think I can do it, but have no experience…
      	• Said adios to the ladies then had some jovial chats with zack back to the hotel. We were out late, drank a lot, and were really ready for bed. What a great way to ring in the new year

      2022.01.01
      	• Keep waking up at the same time every day. Could sleep in, but body won’t let me
      	• Wake up, clean up, breakfast, and go
      	• We weren’t full set on where to go or what to do for the day, but after talking about it and pushing Sintra out; we headed down to the train for a ride out to Belem.
      	• Weird but a different train network heading out that direction; but three stops later and we were there
      		○ Weirdly quiet headed out there and growing over the last couple days
      		○ Bad at reading prior and situations, wasn’t /am not sure if it’s because we’ve run out of things to talk about, just enjoying the silence, or if something was wrong
      	• From the station right out to the waterfront and we were immediately confronted with a giant monument we had no knowledge about, but hot damn it looked cool
      	• We started making our way, but a marina opening is made us reroute around the boat harbor
      	• Now to the monument, and holy crap what a cool thing! Intricate, massive, way cool
      	• Wandered around it, tried to take it in for a good while; then continued on the waterfront
      	• Slowly meandering down the waterfront, around a couple more harbors, and eventually down to the Tower of Belém, closed (either Covid or New Years) so we admired it from outside
      	• Further along, passed on the military museum, admired the Tomb of the fallen soldier, weired out/confused by the setup of names on the monument (were they the names of the soldiers, as part of the dictatorship, that died trying to preserve their colonial rule in their colonies? Yikes…)
      	• Pushed on a little further after agreeing we needed a place to sit. Nothing past the museum/tomb, so we turned around and headed back
      	• Was a bit of a hike, but found a cozy little Biggy with tables and chairs and posted up next to the walkway overlooking the big river and water. Beautiful spot
      	• Coffee and some charcuterie. Yummy
      	• Good conversation, but still had the vibe there was something under the surface. Not sure how to gauge that correctly and too timid to ask
      	• Despite the apathy, Zack came up with a plan to head to the Electricitu museum. Finished up and walked down that direction
      	• Beautiful park outside the museum, but Buh dum. Closed. Specifically for nEw years. Damnit
      	• There was another one close by, the Coaches museum (horse coaches). Google said it was open, so headed across the tracks to there
      	• Whole place was quiet and it was closed too. Damnit. We have bad luck with museums on New Years
      	• Dejected and a bit bummed, and it was back to the station to wait for the train
      	• Super tired and quiet, just sat there waiting for it, and it eventually came and we made our way back towards town
      	• Idea was to head back to the hotel for a nap and a break. Definitely needed
      	• Zack’s idea was to walk a different loop back there, so we got off early to walk a new route in a new neighborhood
      	• Great call, because this neighborhood was gorgeous. A little more raw and less touristy, but tram tracks abound and it was a great little spot
      	• Continued on, some great shots and views and streets, and we slowly made our way back to the Bairro Alto square
      	• To our luck, the kiosk was open so we grabbed some beers, grabbed a table, and took a load off
      	• Whipped out the backgammon and Zack kicked my ass. Godfuckingdamnit that pisses me off so goddamn much
      	• Finished our beers and the last game, and Zack suggested we head back to a different square and do kiosk beers there
      	• Unfortunately, that kiosk was closed, so we wandered over to a trendy street we’d seen on the way over
      	• A café had a table open, so we snagged it and got setup
      	• Time for some wine and tzaziki. Good stuff
      		○ Bummed the kiosk wasn’t open. Café was less relaxed. Nothing like a kiosk beer - laid back, no stress, just hanging out
      	• Finished up the wine and snacks, then plan was tacos. Zack spotted a taqueria from the café
      	• Walked over and it was 11EU for two tacos. Hell no
      	• Walked back down the hill to a pizza joint we’d noticed the night before, and were intent on some za
      	• No dice. It was closed too. Fuck
      	• We’ll, since we were in the area, we had to give the Mercado another go
      	• The test requirement was still in place, but now we had two self tests on hand. After a quick swab, proof of negative tests, and we were in!
      	• Holy hell, what an incredible setup. About 20 stalls with everything under the sun available to eat and enjoy
      	• We started with a lap around to get our bearings and see what was good and what we were going for
      	• Time for a culinary adventure
      	• Appetizer (octopus salad and wine)
      	• Dinner (shrimp and scallop pasta, oysters, wine)
      	• Dessert (brownie, cookie, wine)
      	• Holy shot was that a lot of food
      	• Wrapped up dessert then headed straight to the metro. Goal was to make it to the lookout before sunset
      	• Got out of the metro and weaved our way through a maze of streets and stairs up to the lookout, and what a beautiful spot. Chocked full of people, but it’s clear why
      	• We arrived just after the sun left, but the colors and the sky were beautiful
      	• Really, a great spot to watch out over the town!
      	• From there, we were both feeling tired and slow, but we walked the steep streets back down to town towards our hotel.
      	• Always with an extra burst of energy, Zack suggested a round of darts at a place we saw a night or two prior. Walked by, closed. Damnit
      	• Back to the hotel. Food coma and tired nap, then writing and watching some football before heading to bed
      	• Until not! A little spurt of energy after our long break had us back out on the town for a little walk. We headed up to the castle (couldn’t get in) and cruised around the Alfama district on a beautiful night before strolling back and clocking out

      2022.01.02
      	• Standard wake-up
      	• Breakfast and out
      	• Quiet walk through town as the city came to life. Jumped on the subway, headed to the car, blindsided by a ridiculous parking fee. What the fuck
      	• No one at the desk, so no option. Fuck
      	• Off and running towards Sintra
      	• Tried to avoid the toll roads, but Google maps is full of bullshit
      	• Got to Sintra, got annoyed with parking and didn’t want to pay. Wrong lot, 20c, then found one on the map in town. Over there in and free. We were off and running
      	• Didn’t look at the map at the start, figured we had to go uphill, so did that, and kinda got stuck
      	• Windy roads but not near anything, doubles back and headed to the city center
      	• There the main castle was waiting for us, so after getting turned around to start we were on track
      	• Waited for the lady to get off the phone to get our tickets, then got the combo pack. Had to book a time for a different castle, but at least we were set
      	• Into the first castle. Holy history batman
      	• Multiple wings of the place, but in use initially as a monastery then castle since around the 15th century. Crazy
      	• One room with the 72 crests of the most noble families, then an incredible old kitchen. That’s what the two giant cones were for, smokestacks for the ovens
      	• Incredible castle, then out and in need of a coffee and snack
      	• Café right on the square, got in and coffee with a super moist and delicious chocolate something or other
      	• Fueled up, off to the bus
      	• Wasn’t sure if it was gonna come - Google said next bus was day after - but after waiting a while the crowd grew and eventually the bus came. Sweet
      	• Super windy road up to the top of the hill and up to the Pena palace
      	• Immediately felt like we walked into a massive tourist trap - tuktuks, taxis, and tourists strewn about everywhere. But we already paid for entrance so had to see what we were in for
      	• What a cool spot
      	• Crazy looking castle perched on the peak of a hill overlooking the ocean, the land, and everything
      	• The castle looked like it was created by a 4yo in art class, random colors and shapes all over the place
      	• We walked up the hill with increasingly better views each step of the way
      	• First made our way up to the tiny courtyard and we’re really digging the place
      	• A walk around the walls was first for some incredible views of the surrounding land. Beautiful perch for a castle
      	• The wall wrapped around back to a rear courtyard and it was full of people taking selfies and overly posed shots. I hate civilization…
      	• We wandered around for different views there, then up to the tiny chapel
      	• There learned that the castle was of German design, as the stained glass was from Nürnberg and the coat of Sachsen was up there too
      	• Next was the tour through the castle. It was packed with people (is Covid real?), but another cool castle jaunt
      	• Crazy opulence, expensive tastes
      	• This was apparently used right up to the overthrow of the monarchy (the queen departed for exile straight from there it said)
      	• Out of the castle, more views, more astonishment of the crazy design of the place on top of the hill
      	• Thought about going to see a random statue, but opted to hear straight to the moor castle
      	• Waltzed on over and totally different feel - nature walk with big boulders spread throughout
      	• A few info signs on the way, and eventually made it into the castle walls
      	• Snack break at the moor castle. Definitely needed, we were quite low on energy. Couple bags of sweet potato chips and a 7up were enough to top us off for the time being
      	• Refueled and ready, we cruised around the giant cistern (apparently there is a king at the bottom - it’s never been emptied), then up to the walls with some great views
      	• Tons of wall walkways and perched over the whole valley
      	• Cruised around the low spot then followed the wall to the path at the upper spot
      	• A good few people mulling about but found a spot to perch and take it all in. Crazy old spot still standing with an incredible (not as incredible as Pena) view over the whole area
      	• From there, we started the long trek back down the hill to town
      	• First through the woods, then the winding road, then through town. Luckily enough, Rupert was still there and we were off!
      	• Next stop, Tomar. Was an easy enough drive to make it up there
      	• Got some pretty views as the sun went down and made it into town a little after dark
      	• Easier spot to find parking, and went and got checked into our hostel
      	• Quite the chic place, and super friendly lady
      	• Got settled and squared away and then off to dinner
      	• First recommended place didn’t look to have much, so we scooted along
      	• Stumbled upon a different place after the brewery that wasn’t a brewery and we dove in. Looked like a good spot
      	• Got in, a cursory question about covid and seated
      	• The waiter kinda seemed like the owners son, wanted to do a good job but had no interest in being there
      	• Good apps and cheese, then. Grilled octopus. I’d never had a whole octopus, so wasn’t quite sure what all was edible, but good stuff
      	• Wine was delicious, and ended up getting dessert. Holy shit it was good. Kinda like tiramisu but I can’t remember what it was called other than yummy
      	• During Dinner, Zack threw out a great question - if I had to reduce my summary of a trip down to the answers of 10 questions, what would they be?
      		a. What was good? Bad? Different?
      		b. Best food? Drink?
      		c. Most memorable interaction? With a local?
      		d. Most frustrating experience?
      	• After dessert, the guy (Portuguese George just brought us a digestif shot (we think it was Ginjinha) and super nonchalant about it
      	• After the first he just dropped two more for us, and then after the third said that was it
      	• Super friendly and great waiter and dude. Fun times there
      	• Paid and we’re off
      	• Down for another beer, headed back to the first place after a little stroll through town
      	• Had a whole giant footrest under the bar and Zack was all kinds of jazzed about that
      	• Snagged a couple beers and zack was infatuated with the super tiny glasses. Got our next beers out of that and Zack ended up walking home with one. Atta Boy
      	• Back to the hostel and out

      2022.01.03
      	• Meager breakfast, but surprised with some free eggs so made some scramble. When life gives you lemons…
      	• Dropped our bags at the car then headed to the post office for stamps. Quite the busy place, even had a pull number setup to organize the maelstrom
      	• Got our stamps, sent off the cards, then up to the Knights Templar Castle
      	• Easy drive up and it was still foggy and misty, added a cool vibe to the whole complex as we walked on in
      	• Short little walk around the main courtyard then skirted around to the main entrance and dove in
      	• The whole time through felt like I was in a video game - new areas to explore and didn’t want to leave anything out
      	• Tons of history in the place, initially founded by the knights of Templar, but then setup as the HQ for the Order of the Cross after Templar fell
      	• Unfortunately; there was really only information on what the place was used for during the 16th century. Stupidly enough little to no references of the Templar despite having their likeness all over
      	• Wandered around, up and down, all through the castle, convents, and many areas and spits in the place. Big, lots of things to explore, and really cool
      	• The exit plopped is back in the parking lot, so we took a break at the café with a cap and snack. Right before the massive tour group showed up
      	• Nice little break, then back in the grounds to walk the fortress walls huge place, cool ramparts with views of town, and tucked inside a few green spaces and orange groves
      	• Walked the wall then ducked into an orange grove
      	• There are orange trees everywhere here, and I’d been wanting to take one. So in the grove, I popped down and snagged one. It had a ton of seeds, but it was delicious
      	• We continued on through the grove and park and then slowly made our way outta there. Onward
      	• The castle was fed water via an aqueduct, and on the map there were a few sections still standing, so we headdd that way
      	• Holy crap what a find
      	• We parked in a little turnout and wandered through one of the decanting huts to get to the aqueduct spanning the valley, and that thing is massive
      	• 50sth arches and 16sth base arches, the max height was 30m and a long and L-shaped thing. Absolutely insane
      	• Crazy part was, you can walk the whole thing, and only half of it has a semblance of a ridge on the edge. That part with a ridge only goes up to barely knee height, so there’s a lot where you could slip off the edge
      	• I walked the length and it was impressive. It’s been standing for over 400 years, and damn
      	• Crazy setup? And absolutely beautiful
      	• We walked back, looked around, and then drove down next to and under it. Super impressive structure
      	• We had the impression there was more to see (the aqueduct from the source spanned about 6km) so we kept on driving and I found a spot with more spans
      	• The road turned to dirt at some point, so we parked and ventured on foot
      	• Bit of a dirt forest road, but we eventually found one span that was kinda big, then a second span a stones throw away that was even bigger
      	• Crazy that these are just sitting there still
      	• Seemed like portions of the line were destroyed when the little town nearby was built, because I don’t think you could trace the whole aqueduct from start to finish
      	• Crazy to think that they didn’t try and make more of a straight line. Even the huge span itself had a curve/bend in it, seems like way more work than was needdd
      	• Cool bit of exploration and wandering for some cool history
      	• From there, back to the car, back to town
      	• Filled up on gas then hit the market
      	• Stocked up on wine and DAYUM wine is cheap here. Insane
      	• Fueled up and ready we hit the road headed towards the national park
      	• Got a good bit in then stopped at a rest stop for a little picnic
      	• We’d picked up some cheese and bread at the market so snacked on that with our snack bag of stuff. Noms
      	• Back on the road and eventually off into the countryside
      	• Incredible views as I got to ride along with the hills and mountains opening up
      	• Eventually got to where there was a giant chasm of a valley off to the right, and behind it was the mountain we’d be driving up
      	• Incredible ascent with some steep roads and into a rocky barren landscape. Felt a little like my hike in Scotland, but beautiful and bare with some massive views looking out over the country
      	• We stopped for a view and break partly up to take it in, and the sun was starting to find its way down the sky
      	• Pushing on, we headed to Torre, at 1993m the tallest point on continental Portugal. An old abandoned observatory and a few other abandoned buildings sit there, although it’s a national park
      	• We were all kinds of co fused about the history of the place, because national parks aren’t normally crisscrossed with roads, housing giant mountain ski villages, or have abandoned observatories on them. Seemed like a bit of a coverup in the history books
      	• We got to the top and it was windy as shit. Bundled up and wandered to find a good spot to watch the sunset
      	• Below the big abandoned building found what seemed to be a tiny lookout bunker and hunkered down as the sky burned away. Beautiful spot
      	• Wandered past the abandoned buildings, Zack went into the apparently bustling mini market, and I went and checked out the cairn that had no distinguishing remarks
      	• From there back to the warmth of the car and booking a place to stay. Then off down the super windy mountain road to the next town
      	• Beautiful landscapes, bummer only seeing them at dusk
      	• Town was pretty quiet, but we found the hostel (that I think used to be a ski chalet from the dictator era) and got checked in. Honestly, cool hostel
      	• From there to dinner time
      	• Small mountain town, apparently only three restaurants even open
      	• Walked down to the first one, and after having to wait on a family, wr walked in and were shut down. No space, no food service in the bar, no option
      	• Continuing on we walked to restaurant #2, and it wasn’t even open
      	• Next stop would be the last stop, but there was another place open on the way. Stopped in and got a table
      	• We got served with the plates of cheese and sausage and bread and such, but that’s a ploy to make you pay for extensive appetizers
      	• After getting the prices we deciddd on the cheese and bread, and then had some wine to go with some soups
      	• We were still pretty full from the picnic break at the rest stop, so not much room for an actual meal. That worked out perfectly though, as the cheese, bread, soup, and wine were perfect
      	• From there we ambled back up the hill to the hostel in the fresh and cool evening
      	• Once back, bed was on the table, but after a positive reception I found a stream to watch Robin Hood Men in Tights. Zack had gotten a bottle of wine, so we found a way to crack it and were off and running
      	• Such old humor, but still such a funny movie
      	• Polished off the bottle and the movie then off to bed

      2022.01.04
      	• It was windy as shit all night; so I tossed and tuned and woke up a few times even with earplugs in
      	• Earlier Start in the hopes of a morning hike, so up and cleaned then off to breakfast
      	• Decent enough breakfast in the old ski chalet, then talked over the plan
      	• Was way too windy (20-30mph sideways) and now rainy to make a hike even a little bit enjoyable
      	• Cutting our losses, decided to just head off the mountain instead
      	• Super curvy, windy, switchbacky road
      	• Stopped off at one overlook to see the la d down below and enjoy a couple rainbows to boot
      	• Cool towns going through on the way down, then off to the highways headed towards Monsanto.
      	• At some point saw a sign for museum of cheese. Seemed on the way so we rerouted
      	• Got to that village. Place didn’t open for another 20min, and after looking at the pictures it didn’t look good enough for the wait. Off and running through the countryside to get to Monsanto
      	• Could see it from a good ways off on approach, and the road took us all the way up to the village.
      	• Parked and got to exploring
      	• Quite the intricate village, everything was closed down and pretty quiet, but I imagine it’s overblown with tourists in the summer
      	• Wandered around to a few famous/signage’d places, wandering the tiny alleys and enjoying the melancholy weather
      	• Eventually out of the main part of town and and past a few more things then off and climbing uphill to the castle
      	• We worked our way up and holy hell what a cool castle
      	• Zack was on his improv game the whole time, but what an incredible medieval build up at the top of the hill
      	• We climbed up the ramparts then went and did a good bit of exploring around the whole thing
      	• Seriously, what a cool castle!
      	• Unfortunately? While up there, the visibility dropped to shit and it started raining: lame
      	• We explored the whole thing, then over to a different tower in the area, Then a back trail back down to town
      	• On the hunt for a café, but everything looked closed
      	• Stumbled upon the tourist office and met a super eager lady, and a cool town museum
      	• Walked through and learned a lot about the town, history, boulders, and more
      	• It won the award for most Portuguese Village in 1932 and the emblem for that is a silver rooster
      	• After the museum asked her where the original trophy is, and it’s in the local municipality office, but the spire on the clock tower is a replica
      	• Unfortunately no coffee shops open, back to the car and heading out since the visibility was still zero and rain present
      	• Got down fro town, stopped at a place that looked like a café but the guy wouldn’t serve us coffee (I think because we weren’t going to order food)
      	• Back on the road
      	• At the next big town we found a place to grab a coffee
      	• Walked in and the guy had a couple wonderful americanos out on the table in short order
      	• Quiet sipping and finishing of the coffees
      	• Back at the car, Zack behind the wheel
      	• Cruising through the east Portugal countryside then through to western Spain. Weirdly enough vibes of east Texas. Rolling hills, sparse vegetation, nothing for miles except for one giant gate leading to a ranch and then nothing else
      	• Beautiful drive, then driver swap
      	• First sign for Madrid 40km outside of the city, this place is massive
      	• Google pulled another bullshit move and routed us on a road that didn’t exist
      	• Got to the hotel and more expensive parking
      	• Checked in and situated, weird corner shower in the room
      	• Took a load off and relaxed for a bit, then off to town
      	• Plan was to wander and stumble upon a place to get tapas, then a new place for dinner, then drinks
      	• Holy shot there were a lot of people out. An insane amount of people. It was honestly a little overwhelming and worrying
      	• We cruised through a couple main drags and got out of the crowds over to the Chueca neighborhood
      	• Zack spontaneously jumped into a pizza place and that got me to hangry level. I though we were searching for a place together, but he split and smacked
      	• A little anger and frustration and some aimless wandering, then we found a good bar on a tiny square and jumped in
      	• Immediate olives helped lighten the mood, and then we snagged some beers with a cheese plate
      	• The cheeses were a little muted, but the combo was good
      	• Debating what to do next, we opted to move on and head to the bar next door for our next drink
      	• Ended up with an actual and good IPA. Refreshing
      	• Super tiny little hole in the wall bar. Quite the cute and quaint spot
      	• Moving on, we were back to wandering a bit, now on the hunt for food. Ended up a little empty handed, so we opted for the big Mercado in the neighborhood
      	• Time to go to town. Got me a bunch of seafood tapas and it was delicious. Herring with avocado and with Dijon mustard were my favorites
      	• Beers and food in bellies, we wandered on. Down another main drag, then over to a bar Zack wanted to go to (the Hemingway bar), but their week starts on wednesdays…
      	• Direction home but we found a cool spot that looked like a super cool vibe. Guy at the bar said we had to go downstairs for space, and the guy at the bar down there was short and to the point
      	• Looked at the menu and saw a name from my whiskey tours - Pedro Ximenez - and knew that’s what I wanted.
      	• Ended up being a sherry bar, not what we expected, but we sipped on our sweet liquor with the nuts provided. Definitely a lot of history and tons of bottles in that place
      	• Since that was more sweet than what I was ready for, I wasn’t feeling a second glass and we continued on
      	• Not three doors down from that spot, Zack’s eye spotted a craft beer shop. Not legally allowed to skip that over so we dove in
      	• Actual craft beer selection. My god what a refreshing sight
      	• Got a pale ale and Zack an amber; but they were both a little flat and lacking a bit in taste. Bummer
      	• But enjoyed our beers, and from there it was home for the night

      2022.01.05
      	• Standard rise for our last day wandering around
      	• Out on the streets and into the first cool coffee shop we could find
      	• Super trendy, great coffee, and delicious bakery
      		○ When Zack and I travel (he started this and I’ve been working on being more creative with this), we present a lot of What If scenarios
      		○ Cool one in the coffee shop, you were given the resources to setup and start a coffee shop, but it has to be based on a theme, with all/some of the menu items named or created off of that theme. What would the theme be?
      		○ Industry coffee shop
      		○ Fake art movement coffee shop
      	• More wandering around and over to the lab for Zack to get his Covid test so he could fly home




      	• Kinda the drunk Americans at a rooftop bar. To be fair though, they didn’t explain why we couldn’t order coffee. The views were good and the sangria too though



      2022.01.06
      	• Early up and at em
      	• Quiet ride to the airport, and an absolute maze trying to get out of Madrid’s center
      	• Sad to see my buddy Zack off. Another great time with such an incredible person and friend
      	• Off and motoring across Spain
      	• Beautiful landscapes as the day progressed. Early on Pyrenees visible with a beautiful layer of snow from the highway
      	• But of easy Texas morphed into super sw us with red dirt and hills and canyons
      	• Eventually off the main highway and headed towards Andorra
      	• Slowly signs started to seem a bit different, no longer purely Spanish
      	• Then I saw independencia on a bridge and realized I was in Catalonia! A lot different - no longer purely Spanish, different setup in street signs
      	• Eventually worked my way up the mountains and entered Andorra! No fucking clue what language works here, seems to be a weird amalgamation of a few languages on the signs, and a mix of everything from what I heard
      	• Found a spot to park and walked around town, sporadic Salvador Dali sculptures, best kept secret of sneaking into a hotel bathroom, and a walk in the bright mountain sunlight
      	• Then up the road a bit to the moor tower, but absolutely no info related to it. Climbed up and down and a bit disappointed





      Thoughts and struggles
      	• Called out by Zack for asking a question when I already had a preferred option. Had made me question how I approach any question
      	• Being looked down upon, getting my responses or words treated like lesser than, shitty feeling

      Find out and make the sauce from Patatas Bravas

    <h2 id="GBD">Good, Bad, Different</h2>

    <p>Continuing on with the wonderful tradition I gained through the experiences in my CBYX years, here is another installment of <strong>Good, Bad, Different</strong>! This is the part of the story where I categorize (comically, against the teachings of my exchange program cultural training) all of the things that I noticed and what stood out being in an environment foreign to me. With that, here goes!</p>

    <h3>Good</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Technologically with-it as a country. Credit cards, apps, seem to be up with the times, which is un-fucking-believably refreshing</li>
      <li>English proficiency is very high</li>
      <li>There are tons of runners. Everywhere. We were pretty astounded how they were all over the streets wherever we went</li>
      <li>Wine glasses are filled AT LEAST half way. At least. If not damn near full. Now that's a wrinkle I can get behind...</li>
      <li>Jaywalkers. People are not shy about jaywalking and I love that it’s a thing</li>
      <li>Actual nighttime stars are visible from Lisbon and cities. Crazy!!!</li>
      <li>May be just a one-off example, but there was a sign language translation during a newscast. How cool!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bad</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Hostels thus far (up until Lisbon). Zero shits about Covid. Seems a little surprising.... (Might just be a hostel thing)</li>
      <li>Lots of dog shit on the sidewalks... Is picking up after your pets not a thing?</li>
      <li>Stray cats and stray dogs are pretty common. Is this a bad or a different?</li>
      <li>Nickeling and dimeing is everywhere with evverything. Road toll? Only 0.45€ here but 2km down the road it'll be another 0.45€.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Different</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Gender of the Portuguese language is based on who is saying it vs who is the content of the speech (obrigad<strong>O</strong> (thank you) when said by men, obrigad<strong>A</strong> when said by women)</li>
      Portuguese can sound like Spanish or Russian, depending on who’s talking... and when it’s Russian it really sounds like Russian. (we're not crazy here, this was confirmed by a few people and all over the country)</li>
      <li>So many cobblestones. People peg Central Europe for nothing but cobblestone streets, but (at least Porto) takes the cake</li>
      <li>Lots of little mini-cafeteria type shops, similar to what we saw in Cuba</li>
      <li>This is a right-hand traffic country, but trains and metros aren’t (as in when going forward, the vehicle is on the left side of the roadway or set of tracks). Not sure how that makes sense</li>
      <li>Olympic Rings are used as a general sign for sports, not for the Olympics</li>
    </ul>
