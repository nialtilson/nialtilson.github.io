    <p>As the saying goes, it's better late than never, and this is extremely relevant to everything in here. After having COVID middle of last summer, I've been lacking on a lot of updates and goings-on that's filled my life since then. So in the interest of getting my ass and this here blog back up to date, here's a quick shimmy through the last year of activity.</p>

    <h2 id="Love">My Love Life</h2>

    <p>As hesitant as I am to talk about my love life and relationships and all that jazz, I think it's no secret to anyone that that aspect of my life is not only very important to me, but also very inactive. Not ideal. But in the middle of last summer I ended up matching with someone on Bumble, and after some pretty good initial conversation, we met up for the first time in Pforzheim for a bike ride and walk around town.</p>

    <p>The bike ride took us along the river, up onto a plateau and to an awesome bench to watch the clouds, back down to another river, then back into town. There ended up being a music fest that evening downtown so we got some food, and then headed into the music fest for a bit to enjoy the scene. One band there turned out to be pretty catchy (<a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B01On7YZSqA">Vagabund by Kicker Dibs</a>), and overall the date went really well. So well that we lost track of time, and eventually I looked at train times and was in a real tight spot. I had to say a quick goodbye, sprint with my bike to the train station, ride down the stairs and through the tunnels and barely made it to the last train back to Karlsruhe for the night.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, despite the prompt goodbye, things went well and we really hit it off. Through July we were able to meet up a good few times, including a few trips to the lake after work, a short weekend backpacking trip in the Schwarzwald coupled with a visit to the local fire station's fest, and a bunch of random dates here and there. Things progressed quick but super naturally, and needless to say, I was ecstatic to finally have something in my love life slowly come together with such a cool, mature, adventurous, intelligent woman.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning, we maintained really open, honest, and clear communication. That included being frank about what the future holds for both of us. She was in the process of becoming a teacher, and as I learned from her about the German teaching system, that included its own long list of restrictions and complications and the like. I am/was unsure of where my life was truly headed. But on a lot of big topics we matched pretty darn well and that helped draw us pretty close together.</p>

    <p>Summer for her started once she was done with her Referendariat (teacher training) duties for the year, and with that she was off to continue her trek along the <a class="body" href="http://www.via-alpina.org/en/page/237/the-red-trail">Via Alpina</a>. One August weekend I was itching to GTFO of work, and set up with her to jump down and do some of the trail with her over a few days. But I was able to do part of it as a surprise, as I left early, got down there at night to sleep in the car near Klosters Dorf, and then hike up and over a saddle to surprise her early in the small town of Gargellen.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/q494lgch.jpg" alt="She's Comin down the Mountain"></img>

    <p>In that quick stint of the trek I was able to join, we got in four days of hiking together, and in the middle of all of it, made our relationship official. It's cheezy, but I'm kinda proud about how that happened.</p>
    
    <p>In German, "friend" and "girlfriend" are the same word - Freundin. The way you tell them apart is by the presence, or lack thereof, of a possessive pronoun. "A friend/eine Freundin" is friend, whereas "my friend/<strong>m</strong>eine Freundin" is girlfriend. So, to see if we were a thing I asked her "So how do I tell people about you - a friend, or my friend?" Cheeky, but it worked, and with that Theresa and I had something going.</p>

    <p><em>Gonna jump ahead a good bit here to keep these topics here all bundled together.</em></p>

    <p>With that, we slowly integrated our lives together as best we could. We both had a busy summer with full travel plans for both of us. In the midst of all the travel, we did our best to spend time together and have some fun. Some highlights there include goign with my Mommy to a Weinfest in the Pfalz...</p>

    <p>Although she's a cyclist, I got to show her the ropes with some Mountain Biking in Heidelberg and even a dive into bike parks in Lac Blanc!</p>

    <p>Christmas Market time in Heidelberg and in Karlsruhe, and then followed that up with a week down in Austria doing some snowboarding and snowshoeing.</p>

    <p>And a good number of other hikes, adventures, and other stuff around the area. Tons of great conversations, laughs, deep talks, and close times. But due to the nature of both of our situations, slowly we had to keep approaching some deep topics that touched on some long term implications.</p>

    <p>As I mentioned, Theresa was a going through teacher certification. In Germany, it's a pretty rigorous process to become a teacher, which culminates in essentially a 2-year student teaching program, and once you successfully complete that you apply for jobs within the Bundesland (state/county) and then begin your career. Theresa was toying with her prospects and was unsure where things were going to take her.</p>

    <p>Pair that with my situation of not knowing where my life is veering off towards, that made for some tough conversations. Despite the strong bond that'd grown between us, it was a shit-or-get-off-the-pot kinda situation that we'd arrived at, and things got difficult. What it boiled down to was that if we were going to stay together, it would essentially mean that I'd have to be willing to live in Germany my whole life. She was not open to moving abroad, let alone outside of a 3-hr radius from her hometown. No one can fault her for that, she's a family person and that's something I admire. But that put me in quite the pickle I had to really try and work through.</p>
    
    <p>As someone who struggles with big decisions, how the fuck do I work out a decision like that? Both what do I want to do with my life, and would I be willing to never move back to my home country? Not an easy situation. I did my best to hash it out on my own and with the many friends I've got, but I had to see a therapist to work through my ideas. One of the results out of that was a big Pros/Cons list I had to come up regarding living in both the US and in Germany to help try and tackle some of the many questions occupying my head.</p>

    <p>Well, in the interest of brevity and the fact that the true deliberations are better discussed over a beer, eventually it came down to me answering that question - could I see myself living in Germany for always - with a no. And in turn, that put the end spell of our relationship.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, fuck... Finally, someone who's into me and I'm into them, a relationship that matches well, we're happy, we fit well together, and then life moves in a direction opposite of us which leads to a breakup. Granted, there were some aspects from my point of view that were still outstanding for me to think about, but overall, life came at us quickly and pushed things to a T. Since I wasn't able to say I'd be willing to live in Germany forever, we called it a day.</p>

    <p>It has been a tough adjustment flying solo again. Pair that with the heavy unsureness I've been lugging around regarding my future, and it's been touch and go every now and then. Overall, I'm getting through it fairly well, but being single again is a bummer.</p>
