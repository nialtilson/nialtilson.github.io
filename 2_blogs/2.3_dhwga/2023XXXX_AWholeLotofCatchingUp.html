    <p>As the saying goes, it's better late than never, and this is extremely relevant to everything in here. After having COVID middle of last summer, I've been lacking on a lot of updates and goings-on that's filled my life since then. So in the interest of getting my ass and this here blog back up to date, here's a quick shimmy through the last year of activity.</p>

    <h2 id="Love">My Love Life</h2>

    <p>As hesitant as I am to talk about my love life and relationships and all that jazz, I think it's no secret to anyone that that aspect of my life is not only very important to me, but also very inactive. Not ideal. But in the middle of last summer I ended up matching with someone on Bumble, and after some pretty good initial conversation, we met up for the first time in Pforzheim for a bike ride and walk around town.</p>

    <p>The bike ride took us along the river, up onto a plateau and to an awesome bench to watch the clouds, back down to another river, then back into town. There ended up being a music fest that evening downtown so we got some food, and then headed into the music fest for a bit to enjoy the scene. One band there turned out to be pretty catchy (<a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B01On7YZSqA">Vagabund by Kicker Dibs</a>), and overall the date went really well. So well that we lost track of time, and eventually I looked at train times and was in a real tight spot. I had to say a quick goodbye, sprint with my bike to the train station, ride down the stairs and through the tunnels and barely made it to the last train back to Karlsruhe for the night.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/RccuMIjh.jpg" alt="Bike Ride Blue Skies"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7CjHpgMh.jpg" alt="Kicker Dibs"></img>

    <p>Thankfully, despite the prompt goodbye, things went well and we really hit it off. Through July we were able to meet up a good few times, including a few trips to the lake after work, a short weekend backpacking trip in the Schwarzwald coupled with a visit to the local fire station's fest, and a bunch of random dates here and there. Things progressed quick but super naturally, and needless to say, I was ecstatic to finally have something in my love life slowly come together with such a cool, mature, adventurous, intelligent woman.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning, we maintained really open, honest, and clear communication. That included being frank about what the future holds for both of us. She was in the process of becoming a teacher, and as I learned from her about the German teaching system, that included its own long list of restrictions and complications and the like. I am/was unsure of where my life was truly headed. But on a lot of big topics we matched pretty darn well and that helped draw us pretty close together.</p>

    <p>Summer for her started once she was done with her Referendariat (teacher training) duties for the year, and with that she was off to continue her trek along the <a class="body" href="http://www.via-alpina.org/en/page/237/the-red-trail">Via Alpina</a>. One August weekend I was itching to GTFO of work, and set up with her to jump down and do some of the trail with her over a few days. But I was able to do part of it as a surprise, as I left early, got down there at night to sleep in the car near Klosters Dorf, and then hike up and over a saddle to surprise her early in the small town of Gargellen.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/q494lgch.jpg" alt="She's Comin down the Mountain"></img>

    <p>In that quick stint of the trek I was able to join, we got in four days of hiking together, and in the middle of all of it, made our relationship official. It's cheezy, but I'm kinda proud about how that happened.</p>
    
    <p>In German, "friend" and "girlfriend" are the same word - Freundin. The way you tell them apart is by the presence, or lack thereof, of a possessive pronoun. "A friend/eine Freundin" is friend, whereas "my friend/<strong>m</strong>eine Freundin" is girlfriend. So, to see if we were a thing I asked her "So how do I tell people about you - a friend, or my friend?" Cheeky, but it worked, and with that Theresa and I had something going.</p>

    <p><em>Gonna jump ahead a good bit here to keep these topics here all bundled together.</em></p>

    <p>With that, we slowly integrated our lives together as best we could. We both had a busy summer with full travel plans for both of us. In the midst of all the travel, we did our best to spend time together and have some fun. Some highlights there include goign with my Mommy to a Weinfest in the Pfalz...</p>

    <p>Christmas Market time in Heidelberg and in Karlsruhe, and then followed that up with a week down in Austria doing some snowboarding and snowshoeing.</p>

    <p>...and a good number of other hikes, adventures, and other stuff around the area. Tons of great conversations, laughs, deep talks, and close times. But due to the nature of both of our situations, slowly we had to keep approaching some deep topics that touched on some long term implications.</p>

    <p>As I mentioned, Theresa was a going through teacher certification. In Germany, it's a pretty rigorous process to become a teacher, which culminates in essentially a 2-year student teaching program, and once you successfully complete that you apply for jobs within the Bundesland (state/county) you want to teach in, and then begin your career. Theresa was toying with her prospects and was unsure where things were going to take her.</p>

    <p>Pair that with my situation of not knowing where my life is veering off towards, that made for some tough conversations. Despite the strong bond that'd grown between us, it was a shit-or-get-off-the-pot kinda situation that we'd arrived at, and things got difficult. What it boiled down to was that if we were going to stay together, it would essentially mean that I'd have to be willing to live in Germany my whole life. She was not open to moving abroad, let alone outside of a 3-hr radius from her hometown. No one can fault her for that, she's a family person and that's something I admire. But that put me in quite the pickle I had to really try and work through.</p>
    
    <p>As someone who struggles with big decisions, how the fuck do I work out a decision like that? Initially started out with what do I want to do with my life, and now would I be willing to never move back to my home country? Not an easy situation. I did my best to hash it out on my own and with the many friends I've got, but I had to see a therapist to work through my ideas. One of the results out of that was a big Pros/Cons list I had to produce regarding living in both the US and in Germany to help try and tackle some of the many questions occupying my head.</p>

    <p>Well, in the interest of brevity and the fact that the true deliberations are better discussed over a beer, eventually it came down to me answering that question - could I see myself living in Germany for always? - with a no. And in turn, that put the end spell of our relationship.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, fuck... Finally, someone who's into me and I'm into them, a relationship that matches well, we're happy, we fit well together, and then life moves in a direction opposite of us which leads to a breakup. Granted, there were some aspects from my point of view that were still outstanding for me to think about, but overall, life came at us quickly and pushed things to a T. Since I wasn't able to say I'd be willing to live in Germany forever, we called it a day.</p>

    <p>It has been a tough adjustment flying solo again. Pair that with the heavy unsureness I've been lugging around regarding my future, and it's been touch and go every now and then. Overall, I'm getting through it fairly well, but being single again is a bummer.</p>

    <p>I miss Theresa, she's an awesome woman. But now it's back to just me and we'll see what life brings next. It's no lie that having a strong relationship in my life is something very important that I want to have in my life. I had that with her and now it's gone, now I'm back at square one. We'll see what happens next...</p>

    <h2 id="Biking">The Wheels on my Bikes go Round and Round</h2>

    <p>Through thick and thin, good times and bad, my bikes are things that always keep me moving and sane. Fresh air, nature, adrenaline, or just getting from A to B. Bikes are life.</p>

    <p>In the last year I've been doing well at staying constantly in motion with both my new Madonna and trusty Honzo. Some trips around the Rhein area in summer with the great weather and great bike paths, and a good number of times out in the dirt with my MTB buddies over here shredding whenever and wherever we could.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/JPQbyBxh.jpg" alt="Lac Blanc Morning Prep"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/mQKCtJCh.jpg" alt="Waiting for the Ferry"></img>

    <p>In the middle of summer, to the pure delight of all in the area, I was even graced with a visit by the honorable, estemmable, and unmatchable Friar Gnarthaller himself!!! Collette was over for a business trip, and Colin was able to pop along for the ride. One fine work day I took off early and we headed up to Heidelberg to do some shredding. What a fucking blast! His mustache and riding game was strong (as always), and Matze was even able to join along for the ride. What a treat!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CJHa0O7h.jpg" alt="The Ride Crew"></img>

    <p>Due to some night testing for my automated high-beam feature, for some reason in the middle of July, I had a couple free mornings before I had to go into work late. To utilize one of them, I took my Madonna on down to Sasbachwalden and did a big pedal all the way up to the top of the Hornisgrinde. A great view on a great day made the pedal up worth it. But the Rumpelstiltzken trail wasn't all that great there from the top top on down. Thankfully the rest of the trails were, and that was one kick-ass way to start a work day.</p>

    <p>A lot of the riding has taken place up in Heidelberg with the walking Wikipedia that is Franz. Great place to ride and a great person and people (you too Steph!!!) to ride with! Well, just had to round this section out with Franz nomming on some muffins from his hip-pack.</p>

    <h2 id="Brum">Bumming around in Brum (Birmingham)</h2>

    <p>Slowly but surely the world has opened up since the initial couple onslaught years of COVID. Since I'm over here in Europe in a different world, I know I need to start taking full advantage of that! That's been a slow build, but one way I've done that was through a quick weekend trip up to Birmingham, UK.</p>

    <p>One of Zack's great friends, Luke, was living up in Brum as his now fiancé was working for the Commonwealth Games. Not wanting to let the short distance go to waste, despite an initially canceled flight, I eventually made my way up to the UK for a weekend with Luke! Super awesome to be able to see him and hang out!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QIBGSv9h.jpg" alt="Over the Clouds"></img>

    <p>Once I landed I found the train, headed into town, and met up with Luke! He lived pretty close to the station, so we went and threw my bag in their apartment and then we hit the town walking. Apparently Brum has the reputation of being one of the worst cities in the UK, but with it all decked out in stuff for the Commonwealth Games, I didn't find it all that bad. Lots to see and check out, so we meandered our way through town.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/PnAtbr9h.jpg" alt="DownTown Brum"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VdFYoTPh.jpg" alt="Intrepid Wanderers"></img>

    <p>Jelley, Luke's Fiance, was working as an organizer for the Commonwealth Games. I'd never thought about that as a job, but that's what she studied, and was all in deep with the planning and prep for the tournament. Despite the chaos and lack of sleep, we were able to pop over to the Games headquarters and say hi amidst one of her coffee breaks!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bcxG86Vh.jpg" alt="Hey Jelley!"></img>

    <p>That afternoon, we jumped into a good 'ole double decker bus and headed out to meetup event Luke discovered. He was still pretty new in town, so he was being really proactive in finding things to do. The trip took us a bit out of town and over too a sweet outdoor bar place. Good music, some killer Jamaican food, some cold drinks, and even got to watch some lawn bowling as we sat around and chatted with some folks.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fU838Dsh.jpg" alt="Two-level Chariot"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/zItQwHxh.jpg" alt="Heated Lawn Bowling"></img>

    <p>One method Luke was using to get to learn Birmingham was a thing they had going called Key to the City. Essentially a promo-program that set up a ton of scavenger hunts all around town to get to know certain areas, landmarks, buildings, or who-knows-what. In our wandering, we ended up going to a couple of them in different parts of town, including one at a football stadium, one in a shopping mall, and one at an old postage house in a big park. Fun exploration all around.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ert8NHah.jpg" alt="Lead to the Tree"></img>

    <p>It was a quick weekend, but full of really great discussions, chats, adventures, walking, discoveries, and time to get to know Luke. Super fucking cool dude. To back up a little bit, although Jelley was there to work for the Commonwealth Games, they were on an open-ended world adventure that had been going on for a good year with no firm end in sight. Once the games were over, their adventure was set to continue, and through the chats about adventures and summer plans, I'd been invited to join along for one of them! More to come on that later :-)</p>

    <p>But soon enough, the weekend was over and I was back on the plane headed towards Germany. Great to see and hang out with Luke in the UK!!!</p>

    <h2 id="Vogel">Tour de Vogel - Third Time's the Charm</h2>

    <p>Tradition is tradition. Therefore, since summer was around, it was time for the third edition of the Tour de Vogel. Who can say no to some bikes on a beautiful day full of beer? No one. That's who.</p>

    <p>This year, along with Micha and Christoph, Micha's neighbor Stephan was along for the ride. As per usual, we geared up with snacks and goodies and good vibes, but got our pedal on after work one fine August evening. After pedaling from Work to Mischa's house, we polished off an appetizer beer, then hit the ground pedaling.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZAeHLbSh.jpg" alt="Citra Helles"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/p8uGCWLh.jpg" alt="Ready to Ride"></img>

    <p>In comparison to years past, and likely essentially due to the fact that it was a post-workday ride rather than a full day to roll between stops, our journey was a bit shortened. From Micha's place we rolled south down to the Seegugger for a quick drink then the Tour de Vogel started. First Ettlingen, then Durach, and finally in Karlsruhe.</p>

    <p>Another Tour de Vogel in the books. Nothing like great bikes, fun people, and ok beer.</p>

    <h2 id="Balkans">Peaks of the Balkans</h2>

    <p>Here, for consistency's sake to the rest of my blogs regarding travels to foreign exotic lands, see my other post here:  <a class="body" href="">Peaks of the Balkans</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="Mommy">Adventures with Mommy!!!</h2>

    <p>Only a day or two after I'd landed back from Montenegro I was fit and prepped for a monumental visit. After Zack visited me the previous winter to be my first visitor out of the USofA since my moving to Germany, I was ready to welcome my dear, loving, wonderful, and amazing Mommy to town!!! She'd saved up vacation and splurged her way over to Europe and was ready to come see me in my world, and I was stoked to see her on this continent!!!</p>

    <p>I'd worked it out that she'd jump on a train after landing in Frankfurt and make her way down to Karlsruhe with the Deutsche Bahn. Risky move for anyone, but figured I'd give her that experience. Well, that was all just a ruse, because instead I took off work early and made my way with an ICE up to Frankfurt Airport to surprise her when she got off!!!</p>

    <p>Going back to Frankfurt is always a walk down memory lane for me. That was where my CBYX Year really started, and that memory of standing out at the busses in the early morning sunlight with the rest of the crew will always take me back. Well I walked over that lovely bus loading zone to the arrivals area and had a bit of a wait, but after long last, my dear Mommy made it out and was officially in Germany!!! After some hugs we grabbed her stuff, snagged some snacks, and were back on a train headed to Karlsruhe.</p>

    <p>Bummer portion out of the way to start. No family time is ever present without some strife, argument, and bummer vibes. That's always a bummer and annoying, but that's life. Mommy and I both failed on some points of communication coming into the trip, and that resulted in some spats throughout. Unfortunately that's commonplace, but no matter what happens, my Mommy is my Mommy, I'm me, and we'll always work through it and come out positive the other end. I love you Mommy :-)</p>

    <p>Unfortunately for the rest of the work week she arrived, I was still on the clock. But that gave her the chance to do a little exploring around the town and the Rhein valley on her own. That led to her taking the bike and riding around Karlsruhe, jumping on a train and exploring Freiburg and Baden-Baden, and some more adventures in the area. She's a HUGE fan of bakeries (in the US what we call danishes, and in Germany essentially anything sweet you can find in a bakery), so she made sure to get her fill (or at least try) on some of those good German sweets she knew from her childhood.</p>

    <p>A couple unique things that first week. After coming home from work one day I was surprised by some flowers that Mommy got me! No joke, I think that was the first time I'd ever received flowers from someone. And it's no surprise that it was my dear Mommy to be the one!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/LZaWoTEh.jpg" alt="My First Bouquet"></img>

    <p>The next, toward the middle of the week, I had my fantasy football draft with the crew here in Karlsruhe. So we donned on our Packer gear and headed to the garden for the draft. She was welcomed with open arms to our little football crew, and it turned to be a fun night with some grilling and eating and eventually the all-important draft. I didn't end up snagging a great team, but Mommy got in some great conversation, and through the small world we live in we found out that Tim used to live in Wisconsin as an exchange student. How cool!</p>

    <p>For the weekend we had some adventures all planned out. Saturday was a bike tour of the area. That started off with the Karlsruhe Zoo (my first visit there, quite the cool spot), then off to Ettlingen where we got absolutely dumped on with some rain after she got to taste the best ice cream in Karlsruhe (if not Germany), then from Ettlingen we rode all the way out to the Rhein! I was bummed because the Rheinkiosk was closed, but thankfully there was a little food truck open nearby. We snagged soem beers and some bratwursts (she was in HEAVEN!) and enjoyed the passing rain storms under the big umbrellas next to the mighty river.</p>

    <p>Sunday was a chance to dive into the life in the Pfalz through a Weinfest in Gleiszellen! Theresa was also able to join, so the three of us packed our bikes into the train and headed out to the Pfälzer Weinstrasse. Turns out my guest bike is a bit of a POS, so riding was a bit uncomfortable and annoying (sorry Mommy...), but we eventually made it to the village to a pretty dead festival. Not to just let it die, we went for a little walk arounnd the area in the hopes things would pick up.</p>

    <p>Well the rain followed us again that day, but we wandered in the nearby wine fields and along the paths in and around the area. Relaxed, low key, and after the rain came through we got some more blue skies or a short time to enjoy. Eventually our wander took us back into town and by then the Weinfest was up and running, but was not up to standard Pfläzische Weinfest expectations from Theresa. We enjoyed some wine, the good vibes emanating from around the place, and some good fest food to go with it all. A few hiccups, but a great little excursion out to the wine foothills.</p>

    <p>That following week I had off so Mommy and I could get out and adventure. She only had one thing that we absolutely, positively must do, so that for sure made it on the plan, but for the first day we went and played tourist up in Heidelberg. Every time I go up there it's for some mountain biking and to see Franz and Fam, so seeing the sights was pretty cool.</p>
    
    <p>Honestly, such a cool town, and great to explore it with her! We went for a walk along the Neckar waterfront, persued the touristy part of town, then made our way up to the Heidelberger Schloss. First time there and quite a massive castle with a bunch to see. Including a really weird three-legged horse statue. Wasn't sure what the fuck was up with that thing. After the castle we did a little more walking around, but ended the day with a very hearty meal at a German restaurant, where Mommy went full in and got her heart's desire of Brats and Sauerkraut. I'd say a successful day!</p>

    <p>The next day we did our first little road trip. The absolutely-positively-must-do thing was a bit in the middle of nowhere in the Schwabian Alb, so we opted to make that a bit of an adventure. To fill the first day, we headed to the Pumpkin Festival at the Ludwigsburg castle and wandered around the beautiful castle grounds all the while admiring the quirky and often really unique pumpkins and all the stuff people made with them. Amidst all the walking around we found time a relaxed break with some pizza and wine on the grounds, and overall had a great time walking around the beautiful castle.</p>

    <p>From Ludwigsburg we continued on and passed through a small town that apparently had a little lookout tower nearby. We did the little hike and enjoyed the lookout, then from there continued on to Schwäbisch Hall for a quick walkabout. Awesome little town with some beautiful architecture, and it was great to show her that beautiful spot. Although we could have, we opted not to stay there and get a little bit out of town to find a place to stay. Not sure where anymore, but we got checked in, and although the kitchen was closed, were able to snag some beers to go with a few rounds of cards to close out the night with some great conversation.</p>

    <p>At our cozy little Gasthaus Mommy got the chance to experience a true, full German breakfast buffet. Definitely a different experience, but awesome for her to taste and have! It was a relaxing morning with wakeup and breakfast, but after all that we were back on the road and headed to Rothenburg ob der Tauber.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/IghM7toh.jpg" alt="Breakfast Enjoyment"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7lc8dlph.jpg" alt="Country Road from Above"></img><br>

    <p>Definitely a touristy town, but for good reason. A beautiful little old fortress town, and a fun one for me to come back to. I'd been here with Lutz a couple years before, so to be able to walk around it with Mommy, see the many buildings and fortress walls and all that stuff, was pretty fun just going out on a relaxed stroll. We wound our way around and through town, tried a snowball (they were too dry and crumbly), and got in the full veiw of the beautiful little town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber. But from there, it was off to the main event!!!</p>

    <p>First, a little backstory. My dear Mommy is and has always been quite the seamstress. It's been a part of her life since childhood, and has always been at the ready to sew, mend, and hem clothing and anything else we've had that needed fixing or attention as kids. She's also spread that joy and ability to me with a delightful sewing machine of my own, but stemming from her passion for sewing is a massive collection in thimbles. I'm not where or how this collection got started, but I've absolutely contributed to it through all of my travels, being sure to whip up a thimble from wherever I go to help her track my movement through her thimble collection.</p>

    <p>In her preparation and research for the trip, she discovered that there is a thimble museum in Creglingen deep in the Schwäbisch Alb. So in the planning for this first little adventure, that was the main goal. After Rothenburg we wound our way through the tiny valleys and landed at the Fingerhut Museum Creglingen.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/qX076zwh.jpg" alt="Fingerhutmuseum Sign"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/sNKAveVh.jpg" alt="Fingerhutmuseum Dragon"></img>

    <p>This museum is so small that we had to pre-register (give them a heads up) for a tour. So we arrived at our prescribed time and although it was a little quiet to start, eventually a sweet lady came out to give us the tour. She couldn't speak any English so I was also acting as translator, but holy shit was my Mommy in absolute heaven! Honestly, an absolute delight to witness.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, Mommy was absolutely tickled by the whole experience. The lady that gave us the tour was an absolute sweetheart and ready to share all the information she could on the history of thimbles, the history behind some of the pieces in the museum, the history behind her family and how the museum even came to be, and all the other questions that came up. Mommy was like a little kid in candy shop just getting some eyes on all of the many pieces of history behind the glass at this tiny little museum. It was very clear at the end of it, that she was one very happy camper that was able to really dive into one of her clear passions. So glad she was able to have this experience!</p>

    <p>To round out this adventure we plodded from the museum to the town nearby for another little walkabout. We were both hitting hungry levels, so the restaurant in town was there to provide us with some good vittles to fill our stomachs. After that, it was back to Rupert and on the road back home to finish out the first little trip.</p>

    <p>The second roadtrip adventure was a little bit longer and involved us heading south this time through the Black Forest. It was a cloudy and foggy drive down, but the first stop was the Schwarzwald Museum to see what life was like way-back-when in the black forest. I honestly had no expectations for this museum but what an awesome spot. The museum consisted primarily of 8 different homes and farms that had been moved from their original location to the museum to highlight some of the unique aspects and differences between the different regions of the Black Forest. Honestly, a really cool museum that is definitely worth a visit.</p>

    <p>Going on just a hunch, but I think the highlight here for my mom was what came after the museum. To tank up after a bunch of walking around, we stopped off at the cafe to give her the chance to have a truly authentic Schwarzwaldkirschtorte (black forest cherry cake) experience. Luckily enough, although it was a bit touristy, it wsa delicious, and I think she was tickled to have some delicious cake (or just cake in general, that's where I get my sweet tooth...).</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vfgdnnkh.jpg" alt="Schwarzwaldkirschtorte for Mommy"></img>

    <p>After the museum it was back on the road and heading south. The clouds were coming in and out, but on the way we had a couple stops with some great views out over the Black Forest. Quite the beautiful place for a relaxing, laid-back drive.</p>

    <p>I'll admit, this next stop was for me, but we then headed to Titisee so I could reenact a moment way back from CBYX. I mean, you can be as adult as you want, but you gotta have a little child in you to keep the fun going. We found the sign to take some pictures by, then wandered around the town and lake. It was a bit cloudy and rainy, but we didn't let that stop us with the wandering. Rounded that out with some shawarma dinner, and then it was off to a hotel nearby to spend the night.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/UuhcAoAh.jpg" alt="Titisee"></img>

    <p>That next morning it was up and over the Schwarzwald heading east. Our first stop was to Donaueschingen, the source of the Donau/Danube river. This holds a place in my heart just because we had a bar on campus named the Blue Danube with dollar burgers every tuesday, but overall this is the source of a major waterway of Eastern Europe, so it was cool to see where it all starts out.</p>

    <p>We got into town and headed to the source, and it was pretty well revered with soem statues and a bit reservoir around the source. From there we continued wandering around town through some parks and eventually out to a confluence of the 'Dube and another river nearby.</p>

    <p>Continuing on the Donau theme, the next stop was a ways down the road near Immendingen. I'd come up with this spot through my few trips down to the Immendingen Test Center. Nearby the test track there's a spot where the river disappears from ground level, goes underground for a few hundred meters during the summer. I'd always wanted to check it out, but now with Mommy we had the time and space to head that way and see what it's all about. Kinda crazy, that such a massive, vital waterway to a large part of the world can just suddenly disappear and go underground for a stretch!</p>

    <p>After that little nature walk, we jumped back in Rupert and then were hit with an absolutely gorgeous drive. The sun came out, the clouds made themselves sparse but beautiful, and we took the cruise along the northern side of the Bodensee. No joke, an absolutely beautiful drive. Vineyards on both sides of the road and cruising right above the Bodensee, it made for a beautiful drive. Definitely on the bucket list to do a wine tour via bike along that stretch.</p>

    <p>First stop on the Bodensee was to Friedrichshafen. An awesome little harbor town right on the coast of the massive lake, and with quite a few cool things to check out. We got in and did a little walkabout, with a route including the cool tower with views over the Bodensee and over town, a walk along the harbor, a quick visit inside the Zeppelin Museum (still need to go back in there to piss off Zack), and then a nice little break with some food and drink at the little boat show going on. Definitely a cool town that is highly recommendable if you're passing through.</p>

    <p>Next stop on the tour was off to Lindau, another spot from my trip from CBYX. A beautiful tiny harbor town again on the Bodensee, very iconic with its two towers at the entrance to the town's marina. Well this place was still as cool, quaint, and delightful as I remembered it. Mommy and I got a nice little walk around the harbor and up the cool lighthouse to see the town from above, then wandered off away from the main part of town around the shoreline to the big park on the north part of the island. Around there was a little food truck offering up some currywurst, so we dove in for dinner. That was enjoyed along the park, then we jumped back in Rupert to head to a cheap hotel somewhere close by in Austria and called it a night.</p>

    <p>The next day it was time for a little treat, and time for me to relive a trip I made in November 2013. First stop was reverse order from then, but off to Liechtenstein. It's not often one can say they've been to the tiny principality between Switzerland and Austria, but when you're in the neighborhood, why not? So we rolled through the tiny country, parked and wandered around what we could of the castle above Vaduz, and then continued on our journey.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/68leuzRh.jpg" alt="Schloss Liechtenstein"></img>

    <p>Sarganz is just a stone's throw away from Vaduz, so we headed there next. A beautiful old castle on a rise above a gorgeous Swiss Mountain Valley, we pulled in an parked, and wandered up to the castle for a great view. The place was closed (not sure why), but we enjoyed the view, wandered around the grounds that we could, then took the alternative route back down to the car.</p>

    <p>The last leg of our delightful adventure took us to the big city of Zurich. Mommy had her flight back to the US starting from there, so that allowed us to make a quick stop in the big Swiss city and get some exploring in there.</p>

    <p>Once we rolled into town we went and checked in at the hotel, then from there took the train into the city to walk around and explore. We got lucky with an absolutely beautiful day in town, and took advantage of that as best we could.</p>

    <p>Zurich with a great weather day is a really easy place to enjoy. Once we made it to the center of town, we walked along the river down to the lake, adn there took a nice long break on a bench with a beautiful view over the water. We weaved our way in and out of the many small old streets along the way, then after our little siesta on the bench worked our way along the lakefront through a big park and took advantage of the beautiful day. Great place to expore with such a great Mom.</p>

    <p>All the walking around tuckered us out, so we headed back towards the hotel but were in the mood for some food. Thankfully google pointed us in the direction of a mexican restaurant close by. Now I was skeptical with my ever-present shitty experience with mexican food in Germany, but decided this looked worth a try. Turns out it totally was. Got some killer fajitas that were legit and delicious, and we were able to enjoy some good food after a long day of exploring, and sadly enough, our last night before she flew out :'-(</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/eWUVoi3h.jpg" alt="Fajitas con Mama"></img>

    <p>The next morning was an early wake-up for her flight back to the US. We packed up our things, got checked out, and made our way over to the Zurich airport. No matter how much time we spend together, how many disputes come up, or where it is in the world, holy hell it's fucking hard to say goodbye to my Mommy. She's such an amazing woman and an immensely massive reason why not only I am the man I am today, but also how I got to where I am today. It was a true treat to have her be able to come out and see my in my world away from the US and to show her a little bit of life in Germany. I wish she was closer and we could see each other more often, but being able to have her visit for a couple weeks was an absolutely awesome treat.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MVkbpafh.jpg" alt="Bye Mommy :-("></img>

    <p>After I dropped her off at the airport, I hit the road and headed back north. It was early and got to have a sunrise as I was heading home, and then it was back to the next steps of summer. Thanks for coming to visit me Mommy.</p>

    <p>After getting home from Zurich, I had that day at home, and then the following day I was up early to head to the train station to catch a ride up to Hannover.
