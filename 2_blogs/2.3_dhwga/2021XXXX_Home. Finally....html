    <p>After the incredible week of mountain biking in Châtel, I had to hit the ground running and never had the chance to stop and breathe before my path finally pointed me in the direction I've been longing for - Home.</p>

    <h2 id="TwoWeeks1">Two Weeks to go...</h2>

    <h4>Week 1</h4>

    <p>What did I walk into when I got back from France? Pure and utter chaos. All thanks to the terrible delivery from our supplier the day before I took off, and the fact that it seems like nothing happened the week I was gone, Monday through Friday of the first week was pure chaos. Whereas we normally receive software drops once every three months or so, we got six SW drops over four days that week. The icing on the cake, the SW we got on Friday was the right one, but they had to re-compile it for it to be official. So what's that mean? We got the actual final SW on Monday of the second week. JeebusHChrist.</p>

    <p>All that meant long days each day of the week. Testing the new SW, finding the issues, reporting them back, and seeing if the supplier was going to do anything about it. That, all paired with trying to maintain a bit of a life outside of it, I was not home very much. When I was, it was either eating or sleeping, and for some reason for both weeks, I wasn't sleeping well at all. That just added to the stress.</p>

    <p>The weekend between work weeks ended up being really nice. Friday night I tore apart my bikes in order to prep the forks, shocks, and droppers for delivery. I decided to send them off to a workshop while I'm gone to get them rebuilt and service. If I won't be riding my bikes, might as well use the time efficiently, right?!</p>

    <p>Saturday morning was delightful, as Christoph came over for some scrambled eggs and english muffins. A delicious, relaxing, and wonderful breakfast to start the weekend, and then we chatted about my next project that he supplied the idea for. More on that to come once it gets underway!</p>

    <p>Post breakfast, it was nap time. And holy shit I needed it. I passed out hard as soon as I hit the red chair. Conveniently enough, I was out for a good two hours and woke up with just enough time to get out the door. First stop was Tübingen to drop off my bike parts. Got that squared away, and next stop was over to the Hollowells!</p>

    <p>This was a bit of a bittersweet stop, as they only had 20 days left in Germany before their move back to Detroit. So this was the last time I'd be able to come over and hang out and crash with them. But we made it more than fun! Steaks, grilled octopus, indoor racquetball, Catan, another wonderful weekend with my wonderful family. Sad to see they're moving back home, but happy to hear about the great opportunities they'll all be getting into once they're back!!!</p>

    <p>A laid back morning again hanging out, chowing down, and relaxing with the gang was really nice to wake up to. After relaxing on the balcony for a bit, they squared me a way with a ton of moving-away goodies, and I jumped from them to go see my good buddy Yann. Sad to realize that we hadn't seen each other since Slovakia the past year, but we met up and went for a nice little walk around his part of town.</p>

    <h4 id="TwoWeeks2">Week 2</h4>

    <p>The second week ended up being more stressful. Work kinda teetered off a bit, but there was still a ton to do. Due to the delay in a functional software, what I was supposed to be doing over the past three weeks, I had to cram as much of it into the week before departure as I could. To add to that stres, emotions slowly built up throughout the week coming from a number of corners of my mind. All that coupled with the lack of sleep really just wore me down.</p>

    <p>I don't know how, but Tuesday night I got my cry in. Or at least part of one. Wasn't sure how it came to be, but cruising reddit I just got heady, and started bawling. Thinking about a lot of things and it all just came to a T. I had been feeling it coming on for a good while, but despite the need, a few days later everything was kinda back to where it was - emotions high and refilling the dam of tears.</p>

    <p>Friday eventually rolled around, and I was done. Donezo. Finished. Useless. COVID test in the morning followed by PT, then off to work. I don't know if I really got anything useful done, but I was there, and struggled through the day. Finally being able to leave and start trip prep, I was just drained. Made it home, haircut, laundry, and time to pack.</p>


    <p>Early up and out. Weird wait for the guy to come get my car, but a misunderstanding on my end and Rupert was in (hopefully) good hands. Damn having priority status is nice. Super short line, and got my bags squared away. Through security and into the airport. The first time since moving over here.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it was super weird. First time flying in over a year and a half, and first time in the pandemic and everything. Much stricter rules and a few more hoops to jump through.</p>

    <p>But on the other hand, it all kinda feels both the same, and as if it hasn't been nearly a year and a half since the last time I flew. Tons of people, it's all chaotic, but despite it all people somehow make it to their flights without killing each other. So many damn people too, kinda nuts to see.</p>

    <p>As soon as I got out of Germany though, a notable difference. Hearing English everywhere again threw me off immediately. So weird to be able to hear every conversation around and not be able to tune it out. That's one of the benefits of living in a foreign country where the local language is not your first language.</p>

    <p>Through screening and into the lounge for some grub and some time to sit around. Overall almost four hour layover, but once I got to a seat in the lounge and had some food, only about two hours to hang out before heading to the gate.
