    <h1>A SPECTRUM OF GERMANNNESS</h1>
    <br>

    <p style="text-align:center"><strong>It's not Good, it's not Bad, it's just Different</strong></p>

    <p>I recently sent a pop-quiz to my friends from my CBYX years in our group chat, asking them to guess something I recently did (explanation to come). To my amazement and enjoyment, their answers were way more than a direct reply.</p>

    <p>Every answer and the information, memories, feelings, and all behind them put a smile on my face and brought back countless experiences and memories from my times here in Germany. Rather than just spit back an answer, I figured this is a wonderfully hilarious opportunity for some self-analysis, cultural commentary, and some fun to take a look at life over here and how it is seen through an American lens.</p>

    <p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

    <p>Nial just broke two major German labor laws within the past 24 hours. What were they?</p>

    <p><strong>The Replies:</strong></p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Beer / Bier is very important here in Germany. I don't think that's a secret in any way, shape, or form. And not just the substance itself, but the culture of beer is also very important.</p>

      <p>Naturally, peer pressure exists, so when one person gets a beer, that usually means everyone else is taking part in the next round as well. Though it is a thing of peer pressure, doesn't mean people aren't able to bow out and stop or skip a round.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Of late, I've definitely been drinking less, less beer at least. In the few times I've been around others, I've received no pushback or sarcasm for skipping a beer or a round. Granted, those have all been low-key situations, and no pressure like at a sports game or some kind of festival. But no sweat here.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Aldi is a popular grocery store chain, but this info involves any retail store, as all/most retail stores require customers to bag their own items.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>You receive a new, tangible understanding of stress when you're sitting at the end of the register, your things are loading up as the cashier shovels them through the scanner in record pace, and you're just getting your grocery bags up to re-assemble your newly-bought wares as the Oma (grandma) behind you stares aggressively at you as she pushes her two items down the belt.</p>

      <p>No joke, this shit is stressful. So, in the instance where you get behind on your bagging responsibilities, you start getting the stink eye from everyone in the line behind you. It sucks, it's intimidating, and it's just a situation of compounding stress.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I've had my share of times getting behind the belt, as they say (they don't it, it just sounds good). BUT, I've recently evolved in my grocery shopping habits. To be honest, I also have non-German grocery shopping habits, as in I grocery shopping about once every two weeks rather than every other day, so I usually get a lot of stuff.</p>

      <p>To save me the hassle of that stress with mounds of groceries (compounded on the need to structurally soundly pack the bags), I just throw everything back in the shopping car and am able to nicely, slowly, and orderly pack my grocery bags into the trunk of my car. Now that's what I call cheating the system.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>There's a saying in German for escalators - "Rechts stehen, links gehen" which means "Stand on the right, walk on the left". This applies directly to escalators, but also to other forms of transportation where the faster party is supposed to be on the left (for example, it's illegal to pass on the right on the Autobahn). So, in an escalator setting, people that stand still on the steps stand on the right side, and people that walk up the steps walk on the left side.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>To be honest, back in the times where I participated in the public transport system here, it pissed me off how many people lived their lives in such a fairy world. Though it socially frowned upon to do so, lots of people don't pay attentio to the unwritten rule and stand on the left.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>And when people do stand on the left, it pisses me off, because I'm one that doesn't like to let the slow motion of an escalator dictate my speed in life.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Bike lanes are not a foreign concept to most westerners. But, especially for Americans, treating bike lanes only as bike lanes IS a foreign concept to Americans. In Germany, things are a little more stringent and strict. If you're a bicyclist, stay in the bike lane. If you're not, GTFO.</p>

      <p>Cherry-picked for sure, but here's an example of America's attention towards bike lanes.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Not much to say here, I don't think. German's are just taught at an early age to actually follow the signs regarding bikes. I'm a fan of it, as usually it means that bikes are where bikes are supposed to be. My only pet peeve with all of that is on average, German bicyclists are fucking slow.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As much as it annoys me when people are walking in the bike lane, I have yes done it myself a time or two. Sometimes you space out, sometimes you don't realize there's a bike lane there.</p>
