    <h1>A SPECTRUM OF GERMANNNESS</h1>

    <p style="text-align:center"><strong>It's not Good, it's not Bad, it's just Different</strong></p>

    <p>I recently sent a pop-quiz to my friends from my CBYX years in our group chat, asking them to guess something I recently did (explanation to come). To my amazement and enjoyment, their answers were way more than a direct reply.</p>

    <p>Every answer and the information, memories, feelings, and all behind them put a smile on my face and brought back countless experiences and memories from my times here in Germany. Rather than just spit back an answer, I figured this is a wonderfully hilarious opportunity for some self-analysis, cultural commentary, and some fun to take a look at life over here and how it is seen through an American lens.</p>

    <p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

    <p>Nial just broke two major German labor laws within the past 24 hours. What were they?</p>

    <p><strong>The Replies:</strong></p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Beer / Bier is very important here in Germany. I don't think that's a secret in any way, shape, or form. And not just the substance itself, but the culture of beer is also very important.</p>

      <p>Naturally, peer pressure exists, so when one person gets a beer, that usually means everyone else is taking part in the next round as well. Though it is a thing of peer pressure, doesn't mean people aren't able to bow out and stop or skip a round.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Of late, I've definitely been drinking less, less beer at least. In the few times I've been around others, I've received no pushback or sarcasm for skipping a beer or a round. Granted, those have all been low-key situations, and no pressure like at a sports game or some kind of festival. But no sweat here.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Aldi is a popular grocery store chain, but this info involves any retail store, as all/most retail stores require customers to bag their own items.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>You receive a new, tangible understanding of stress when you're sitting at the end of the register, your things are loading up as the cashier shovels them through the scanner in record pace, and you're just getting your grocery bags up to re-assemble your newly-bought wares as the Oma (grandma) behind you stares aggressively at you as she pushes her two items down the belt.</p>

      <p>No joke, this shit is stressful. So, in the instance where you get behind on your bagging responsibilities, you start getting the stink eye from everyone in the line behind you. It sucks, it's intimidating, and it's just a situation of compounding stress.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I've had my share of times getting behind the belt, as they say (they don't it, it just sounds good). BUT, I've recently evolved in my grocery shopping habits. To be honest, I also have non-German grocery shopping habits, as in I grocery shopping about once every two weeks rather than every other day, so I usually get a lot of stuff.</p>

      <p>To save me the hassle of that stress with mounds of groceries (compounded on the need to structurally soundly pack the bags), I just throw everything back in the shopping car and am able to nicely, slowly, and orderly pack my grocery bags into the trunk of my car. Now that's what I call cheating the system.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>There's a saying in German for escalators - "Rechts stehen, links gehen" which means "Stand on the right, walk on the left". This applies directly to escalators, but also to other forms of transportation where the faster party is supposed to be on the left (for example, it's illegal to pass on the right on the Autobahn). So, in an escalator setting, people that stand still on the steps stand on the right side, and people that walk up the steps walk on the left side.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>To be honest, back in the times where I participated in the public transport system here, it pissed me off how many people lived their lives in such a fairy world. Though it socially frowned upon to do so, lots of people don't pay attentio to the unwritten rule and stand on the left.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>And when people do stand on the left, it pisses me off, because I'm one that doesn't like to let the slow motion of an escalator dictate my speed in life.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Bike lanes are not a foreign concept to most westerners. But, especially for Americans, treating bike lanes only as bike lanes IS a foreign concept to Americans. In Germany, things are a little more stringent and strict. If you're a bicyclist, stay in the bike lane. If you're not, GTFO.</p>

      <p>Cherry-picked for sure, but here's an example of America's attention towards bike lanes.</p>

      <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/3nqMqCc.jpg" alt="US Bike Laneage"></img>

      <p>In Germany though, I've got a feeling that overall bicycle education and handling is a part of the plethora of things parents and society are required to teach kids over here. Granted, bike riding is a much more integrated part into your average German/European's lives, so knowing how to not be an idiot around them makes a big difference.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Not much to say here, I don't think. German's are just taught at an early age to actually follow the signs regarding bikes. I'm a fan of it, as usually it means that bikes are where bikes are supposed to be. My only pet peeve with all of that is on average, German bicyclists are fucking slow.</p>

      <p>Here, there are also many shades of bike lanes. Some are the kind I recognized, thick white lane lines on the street. Soem are separate paths near the street. But there's also a flavor that throws newbies for a loop, the different colored pavers/bricks on teh sidewalk. This kind is just integrated into the sidewalk and can be easy to lose track of or recognize.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As much as it annoys me when people are walking in the bike lane, I have yes done it myself a time or two. Sometimes you space out, sometimes you don't realize there's a bike lane there.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Germans love their (3 kinds of) beer. A lot. German's also work, but those are not allowed to be mixed. Especially from my knowledge, in any of the places I've worked here in Germany, alcohol has been strictly forbidden.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Yes, beer is verboten at work, and yes Germany is big on beer, but weirdly enough I've yet to experience a clear mix of beer and work. My comparison here is grabbing beers with coworkers after work. I've yet to really experience that here.</p>

      <p>Granted, everything I say regarding this year has been extremely influenced by COVID, so it's likely my experience this go'round is not the standard experience, per se. Also, my workplace makes that a little difficult. We're not anywhere close to a town or dorf or any kind of civilization and most all of the people that work there (including my team) live anywhere within a 30-50 mile radius. So those conditions aren't ripe for post-work beers.</p>

      <p>My boss has mentioned it to me a couple of times though, but even in his experience, happy hour with your coworkers is a seemingly foreign concept here. Honestly, lacking that kind of camaraderie has been quite the bummer.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As with anything, rules are meant to be broken. Despite beer being VERBOTEN at work, I've had the opportunity to enjoy one real and one non-alcoholic beer (two separate occasions) at work over here. Those are the only details you get. But, that does not meet the proscribed 2-beer norm as mentioned above. Hence the "No".</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Preeeeeeeeeeeeety self-explanatory here.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Here, it doesn't mean a damn thing who you are, who you know, or where you work. If you walk into a room and it's the morning time, it's like you are socially required to say good morning. Can't say how many times some random person has walked by, I have no fucking clue who it is, but I get a cheery good morning from them.</p>

      <p>Strangely, this isn't just localized to good mornings, but with any kind of greeting. Good morning is just the most prominent under this vein of thought.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Maybe I'm just not the cheery kind, or maybe I just find it weird, or maybe I find it a little overkill to expend that kind of energy on absolutely everyone I cross paths with in the morning.</p>

      <p>As a specific example of this, I'm on really good terms with one of my coworkers named Paul. We always give each other the stink-eye in jest, but spirits are high when we're in contact. Well one day, I walked into the office in the morning on my headphones tuning into a meeting. I just kinda blazed through and got to my desk as I was on a call. Well, later in the day, Paul gave me a real stink-eye and stink-face, and I asked him way. Slightly in jest, but I think a good amount of seriousness, he called me the "Arrogant American" because I didn't tell him good morning.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Fairly dissimilar to most workplaces in the US, most German workplaces have a Kantine (cafeteria) somewhere in the building. Even for smaller workplaces in a big office building, the building usually has a place that all tenants (and sometimes the public) can eat at. Therefore, it's extremely common for teams (usually your direct coworkers, sometimes people from other teams) to yell "MAHLZEIT" and then head out to get lunch together.</p>

      <p>I think for this reason, and for this reason alone, the HQ buildings of DTNA in Portland both have cafeterias.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>So this feeds into a couple other points on this list, and is a little long winded. So I'll try and make it brief:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work hours are tracked from clock-in to clock-out, even for salaried employees</li>
        <li>Within that clock-in and clock-out time, subtractions are made (in my building's case) for a 15-minute break and a 40-minute lunch</li>
        <li>Because of this, lunch time is time OFF THE CLOCK</li>
        <li>During lunch however, I have yet to sit with a coworker that has talked about anything other than work (unless I change the conversation)</li>
        <li>That being the case, I have no qualms sitting alone for lunch to actually get a break from work</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Fuck That!!! Why would I talk about work when I'm not on the clock? There are so many other things to chat about, either that or let me charge my lunch time. So stupid.</p>

      <p>Kinda got off track there, but yeah, I sit alone for lunch fairly often. Because of COVID, the chairs are super spread out, so even going to the cafeteria with a coworker I can barely hear someone from across the table aka room. So I'm fine sitting with myself, eating and then going back to work. I guess that is one thing keeping me from going full-German.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>This one's a bit hard to explain. You know how I mentioned the fervence of greeting everyone with good morning in the morning? Well, in every German's internal clocks, once the clock strikes 10:30, that 'good morning' changes to 'Mahlzeit', and changes to a mix of other things as soon as 14:00 hits.</p>

      <p>Literally translated, Mahlzeit means meal time.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>I think this utterance is even more prevalent, fervent, and present than Guten Morgen. And no joke, this is a socially acceptable (and expected) behavior that spans a roughly 3.5 hour window.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>My interaction this weird and unique phenomenon goes all the way back to my internship in Hamburg. I'd always bring lunch, and around lunch time I'd head to the small break room, plop down on my own (see above), and start eating. Not everyone there took lunch at the same time as me, but anyone who'd go up or down the hall would always pop their head in and always say the same thing, "Mahlzeit".</p>

      <p>It honestly confused the hell out of me. Mahlzeit. Meal time. Yes, I knew I was eating. That's why I had a sandwich in my hands. Was there really a need to remind me of this? It seemed so patently obvious that verbalizing the realization was extreme overkill. I never understood this.</p>

      <p>Until I talked to my then-boss, after I briefly inquired about it. Only then did I learn that this was a custom that made no sense to me.</p>

      <p>And ever since then, it has only grown in its prevalence in my daily life here. Then, I only experienced it right at the exact time I was eating. Now, it's a half-day long phenomenon. I don't know how this weird tradition came to be, how it seems to make sense in the minds of Germans, or how I can get away from it (I can't. It's everywhere.), but it's here, and I have to get used to it.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, for most non-Germans, and the laid-back Germans, it's a thing to laugh about and make fun of. But for everyone else, I don't think they know how unique and (imo) strange this habit is.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Here, maybe an hour might not be the right bar to set. But essentially it boils down to you did not use the full extent of your allotted lunch time. For example, our office has a 40 minute lunch break built into our time clock. So for me, this would boil down to me taking anything less than a 40 minute break for lunch.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Not sure how to speculate on this one. Maybe to two points. Following by the rules - if you're given a 40 minute break to eat your lunch, you use the 40 minute break to eat your lunch. The second point, well, again, I'm not really sure how to divulge on this other than it's just peer pressure and the social pressure to follow the herd.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Weirdly enough, I'm usually taking a quicker lunch break. For multiple reasons. But the main one is, why waste time sitting around if I'm done eating when I can go back to work and get something done. Kinda stupid to hold to a set time every day when you're guaranteed to have a different lunch experience every day with a little variety to change the timing and situation up. Go with the flow. Not that hard to do.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>There's a little nuance to throw into this one. Staying late can be a bit subjective due to how working contracts are set up. Every worker/employee/whatever has an hour amount that is tied to their contract dictating how many hours they're expected to work per week. For example, I have a 40-hour contract, a lot of my coworkers have 35-hour contracts, and they can vary.</p>

      <p>So if you work your standard daily hours (for me it's 8, for my coworkers it's 7), and then work a little bit over that amount, then no sweat.</p>

      <p>However... In Germany there is also a federal law that you are not legally allowed to work more than 10 hours in a day. So, if you work more than 10 hours in a day, that's where the whole legality of it all dissolves.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Experience from my group though, to be honest, no one gives a shit about those rules. Going above your daily hours just means more vacation. And going above the 10 hour limit, just means you don't clock out and fudge your hours on the time system to make it show that you didn't work over 10 hours. The law is there, people just work their way around it and are pretty unashamed about it.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I've done both. The working over 8 hours a day is a huge plus in the long run (sucks in the short because it's more of life wasted towards work), because that means I get just that much more vacation!!! In a real non-COVID world it'd be amazing. So I've been wracking up hours and saving for this summer HOPING I'll get the chance to travel and get the FUCK out of here.</p>

      <p>And yeah, on the 10 hour part, I've done that too.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>None needed.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Well, Germans are stereotypically classified as a timely bunch. That holds true in some areas of life and doesn't hold water in others. When it comes to work though, things are usually pretty punctual. If someone sets a meeting for a certain time, you're expected to be there ready to go at or before that time. I've got the assumption this is held to a higher standard at some business compared to others, but my impression is that this is a pretty common understanding and rule that people hold to.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>When it comes to meeting start times, this is pretty true. Usually people are there at (and in my experience actually a hair after) the time of a meeting start.</p>

      <p>Whether things hold to the designated end time of a meeting though, that's a whole other fucking world. I could go long on this one, but German's like to talk and discuss and go into detail. With that, if someone has a set amount of time alotted to their point, that is usually just a formality and that doesn't hold any weight in anything. My heavy impression on this aspect is a little biased based off of one monthly experience, but I digress...</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>This one does not fully make sense, as it (in my experience) is a bit of a mash-up of two different concepts. That, or my experience here is very non-typical. Either way, I'll break it down according to my understanding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stammtisch</strong> - this is essentially a meeting group of individuals that meet up regularly (weekly, monthly, whatever) at your local brewery, shoot the breeze, drink beer, and eat whatever hefty delicious cuisine the place is serving up. Due to the consistency of the meeting, these groups usually have their tables reserved well in advance (likely due to decades of consistently being there, same time, same place).<br>
        The reason I break this aspect out of the overall assertion is that Stammtisches (again, my experience) are derived from non-work groups. Sport clubs, activity groups, essentially groups of people (not based off of a work environment) that do things together will establish a Stammtisch. So rather than coworkers, it's your buddies and friends that you do ____ with after work or on the weekends.</li>
        <li><strong>Happy Hour Culture</strong> - this is what I'll refer to as the concept of going out to drinks with your coworkers. Could be a regular deal, could not. But this is what I'll break out as it's specifically work-focused or work-related, compared to a Stammtisch, which is not.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>From that, I consider there to be two categories, one work-related (Happy Hour) and one not-work-related (Stammtisch).</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Stammtisches appear from my exposure to be a very common part of life here in Germany, or even jusy a common part of a German's life. </p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>When it comes to Stammtisches, I've been to a Stammtisch for the local Mountain Biking group, one for German expats when I was in Portland, and maybe one or two others. It's a good time for people to meet, shoot the breeze, and connect on whatever was the topic/core of that group's Stammtisch.</p>

      <p>As for a semblance of a Happy Hour culture here in Germany, I have yet to see anything like that, which is a bummer. My work location probably plays a big role here, being isolated from any kind of restaurants or breweries or anything, along with all of my colleagues living in a very spread out proximity to work, so that doesn't provide a good opportunity to grab beers after work.</p>

      <p>My boss has tried to get our team to meet up after work for a drink, but it's only happened once, and it was planned a good month in advance, and even then it was only four of us. Not a popular concept.</p>

      <p>Expanding upon this, I'm reminded of a very fitting hypothesis that my amazing buddy Zack shared with me at some point. It goes something along these lines...</p>

      <p class="quote">If you can't have a beer with your coworkers, then they might not be good coworkers.</p>

      <p>I say that to provide a distinction. Just because my team/coworkers don't go out for drinks, really ever, does not mean that they wouldn't be fun to have a drink with. Beer culture is part of life itself over here, and all the folks I work around live up to that, as far as I've seen or experienced.</p>

      <p>The difference here I think is the difference of where I'm at in life compared to everyone I work around. Clarified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Me</strong> - 30, single, no kids, non-home owner, foreigner</li>
        <li><strong>My Coworkers (generalized)</strong> - mid-30s-60s, married/partnered, kids, home owner, local</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All that to say, I'm in a different life stage compared to most of my coworkers. Which is kind of a bummer, but that's how it is.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>For those that don't know, German's have a literal law on the books called the <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a>. This restricts/requires that anything that be sold as beer that has been brewed in Germany be made with only water, barley, and hops (and later added to that list, correct me if I'm wrong Ryan, yeast). Germans are very proud of this law and their pride of this law manifests itself into the importance of German beer in the German culture.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>The Rheinheitsgebot has, in my opinion, implanted a sense of entitlement and superiority for German's and their German beer. The concept that beer could possibly brewed with other items other than the strict limit of water, barley, hops, and yeast, is a foreign concept to them. Since it's inception in Bavaria in 1516 it's grown in implementation throughout the country and been held to pretty religiously.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As you might tell, I've got a serious bone to pick with German beer, and I'm not shy about it. There is NO/little variety here. Pilsners, Lagers, Wheats, and Black beers. Other than the wheat beers, they nearly all taste the same. Maybe that's due to my taste bud's, but I don't consider there to be any variety. Yes, every dorf has THEIR brewery. Woohoo. Doesn't help that Dorf 1 has a special pilsner that Dorf 2 somehow produces damn nearly the exact same thing just with a different name. This is a very poor comparison, but it kinda feels like beer inbreeding. You gotta mix up the population (brewing ingredients) to keep it good.</p>

      <p>In comparison, I could walk into nearly any bar or brewery in Portland and have to choose between a Lager, Pale Ale, IPA, Stout, Sour, Cider, Porter, Tripel, and who knows what else. Variety. Variety in taste, ingredients, color, intended flavor. Goddamn I miss that.</p>

      <p>Again, I've shared this view point a few times and I can't remember a time where a German conceded, or seriously acknowledged my point. For the whale's majority over here, German beer os best beer and there's no questioning that. And, in my opinion, that strong belief comes with either some pretty thick blinders, some very specific (not necessarily bland, but just very concentrated just on certain tastes) taste buds, some incredible cultural blind pride, or a mix of all of the above.</p>

      <p>The crux of this point was simply saying "American beer is good". I took this further than that, simply because I've got a bone to pick with German beer pretentiousness, and the fact that even if you say that, you'll likely get some quip back about how German beer is better. That's my biased view.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I think I've been on the staying-home end of this a time or two. I can be social, but sometimes I just don't want to do anything or get less-energetic feeling regarding what I'm about to go do. I feel like that's pretty universally human, right?</p>

      <p>I have been on the ghosted end of this a time or two. And yeah, it's not cool. Biggest example happened last Fall. I elected to host my fantasy football league over to watch the early NFL games on a Sunday night. About 6 people RSVP'd so I made sure to have enough beer and snacks at the house to be a good host and have a good time. Sunday night comes - not a single one shows up...</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Football (soccer) is the most popular sport here in Germany. I think by a landslide.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>I don't have enough exposure to this here to really provide some thoughtful commentary. I did some looking up on Wikipedia (apparently football/soccer is more universally known as <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">Association Football</a>?), and it appears the earliest form of soccer (known) occurred in China. The game then was called "cuju" literally "kick ball". Then in Europe. the most prevalent origin of the sport stems from England.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Don't have much in terms of soccer origin discussions with Germans, so my experience here is pretty limited to just watching soccer either in a stadium, a bar, or on the couch.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>German bread is a staple of the culinary culture over here, similar to beer. There has actually been a push to enshrine <a class="body" href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-bread-vies-for-unesco-recognition/a-17456446">German Bread in the UNESCO registry as an Intangible Cultural Heritage</a>.</p>
