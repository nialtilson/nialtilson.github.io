    <h1>A SPECTRUM OF GERMANNNESS</h1>

    <p style="text-align:center"><strong>It's not Good, it's not Bad, it's just Different</strong></p>

    <p>I recently sent a pop-quiz to my friends from my CBYX years in our group chat, asking them to guess something I recently did (explanation to come). To my amazement and enjoyment, their answers were way more than a direct reply.</p>

    <p>Every answer and the information, memories, feelings, and all behind them put a smile on my face and brought back countless experiences and memories from my times here in Germany. Rather than just spit back an answer, I figured this is a wonderfully hilarious opportunity for some self-analysis, cultural commentary, and some fun to take a look at life over here and how it is seen through an American lens.</p>

    <p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

    <p>Nial just broke two major German labor laws within the past 24 hours. What were they?</p>

    <p><strong>The Replies:</strong></p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Beer / Bier is very important here in Germany. I don't think that's a secret in any way, shape, or form. And not just the substance itself, but the culture of beer is also very important.</p>

      <p>Naturally, peer pressure exists, so when one person gets a beer, that usually means everyone else is taking part in the next round as well. Though it is a thing of peer pressure, doesn't mean people aren't able to bow out and stop or skip a round.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Of late, I've definitely been drinking less, less beer at least. In the few times I've been around others, I've received no pushback or sarcasm for skipping a beer or a round. Granted, those have all been low-key situations, and no pressure like at a sports game or some kind of festival. But no sweat here.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Aldi is a popular grocery store chain, but this info involves any retail store, as all/most retail stores require customers to bag their own items.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>You receive a new, tangible understanding of stress when you're sitting at the end of the register, your things are loading up as the cashier shovels them through the scanner in record pace, and you're just getting your grocery bags up to re-assemble your newly-bought wares as the Oma (grandma) behind you stares aggressively at you as she pushes her two items down the belt.</p>

      <p>No joke, this shit is stressful. So, in the instance where you get behind on your bagging responsibilities, you start getting the stink eye from everyone in the line behind you. It sucks, it's intimidating, and it's just a situation of compounding stress.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I've had my share of times getting behind the belt, as they say (they don't it, it just sounds good). BUT, I've recently evolved in my grocery shopping habits. To be honest, I also have non-German grocery shopping habits, as in I grocery shopping about once every two weeks rather than every other day, so I usually get a lot of stuff.</p>

      <p>To save me the hassle of that stress with mounds of groceries (compounded on the need to structurally soundly pack the bags), I just throw everything back in the shopping car and am able to nicely, slowly, and orderly pack my grocery bags into the trunk of my car. Now that's what I call cheating the system.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>There's a saying in German for escalators - "Rechts stehen, links gehen" which means "Stand on the right, walk on the left". This applies directly to escalators, but also to other forms of transportation where the faster party is supposed to be on the left (for example, it's illegal to pass on the right on the Autobahn). So, in an escalator setting, people that stand still on the steps stand on the right side, and people that walk up the steps walk on the left side.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>To be honest, back in the times where I participated in the public transport system here, it pissed me off how many people lived their lives in such a fairy world. Though it socially frowned upon to do so, lots of people don't pay attentio to the unwritten rule and stand on the left.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>And when people do stand on the left, it pisses me off, because I'm one that doesn't like to let the slow motion of an escalator dictate my speed in life.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Bike lanes are not a foreign concept to most westerners. But, especially for Americans, treating bike lanes only as bike lanes IS a foreign concept to Americans. In Germany, things are a little more stringent and strict. If you're a bicyclist, stay in the bike lane. If you're not, GTFO.</p>

      <p>Cherry-picked for sure, but here's an example of America's attention towards bike lanes.</p>

      <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/3nqMqCc.jpg" alt="US Bike Laneage"></img>

      <p>In Germany though, I've got a feeling that overall bicycle education and handling is a part of the plethora of things parents and society are required to teach kids over here. Granted, bike riding is a much more integrated part into your average German/European's lives, so knowing how to not be an idiot around them makes a big difference.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Not much to say here, I don't think. German's are just taught at an early age to actually follow the signs regarding bikes. I'm a fan of it, as usually it means that bikes are where bikes are supposed to be. My only pet peeve with all of that is on average, German bicyclists are fucking slow.</p>

      <p>Here, there are also many shades of bike lanes. Some are the kind I recognized, thick white lane lines on the street. Soem are separate paths near the street. But there's also a flavor that throws newbies for a loop, the different colored pavers/bricks on teh sidewalk. This kind is just integrated into the sidewalk and can be easy to lose track of or recognize.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As much as it annoys me when people are walking in the bike lane, I have yes done it myself a time or two. Sometimes you space out, sometimes you don't realize there's a bike lane there.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Germans love their (3 kinds of) beer. A lot. German's also work, but those are not allowed to be mixed. Especially from my knowledge, in any of the places I've worked here in Germany, alcohol has been strictly forbidden.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Yes, beer is verboten at work, and yes Germany is big on beer, but weirdly enough I've yet to experience a clear mix of beer and work. My comparison here is grabbing beers with coworkers after work. I've yet to really experience that here.</p>

      <p>Granted, everything I say regarding this year has been extremely influenced by COVID, so it's likely my experience this go'round is not the standard experience, per se. Also, my workplace makes that a little difficult. We're not anywhere close to a town or dorf or any kind of civilization and most all of the people that work there (including my team) live anywhere within a 30-50 mile radius. So those conditions aren't ripe for post-work beers.</p>

      <p>My boss has mentioned it to me a couple of times though, but even in his experience, happy hour with your coworkers is a seemingly foreign concept here. Honestly, lacking that kind of camaraderie has been quite the bummer.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As with anything, rules are meant to be broken. Despite beer being VERBOTEN at work, I've had the opportunity to enjoy one real and one non-alcoholic beer (two separate occasions) at work over here. Those are the only details you get. But, that does not meet the proscribed 2-beer norm as mentioned above. Hence the "No".</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Preeeeeeeeeeeeety self-explanatory here.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Here, it doesn't mean a damn thing who you are, who you know, or where you work. If you walk into a room and it's the morning time, it's like you are socially required to say good morning. Can't say how many times some random person has walked by, I have no fucking clue who it is, but I get a cheery good morning from them.</p>

      <p>Strangely, this isn't just localized to good mornings, but with any kind of greeting. Good morning is just the most prominent under this vein of thought.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Maybe I'm just not the cheery kind, or maybe I just find it weird, or maybe I find it a little overkill to expend that kind of energy on absolutely everyone I cross paths with in the morning.</p>

      <p>As a specific example of this, I'm on really good terms with one of my coworkers named Paul. We always give each other the stink-eye in jest, but spirits are high when we're in contact. Well one day, I walked into the office in the morning on my headphones tuning into a meeting. I just kinda blazed through and got to my desk as I was on a call. Well, later in the day, Paul gave me a real stink-eye and stink-face, and I asked him way. Slightly in jest, but I think a good amount of seriousness, he called me the "Arrogant American" because I didn't tell him good morning.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Fairly dissimilar to most workplaces in the US, most German workplaces have a Kantine (cafeteria) somewhere in the building. Even for smaller workplaces in a big office building, the building usually has a place that all tenants (and sometimes the public) can eat at. Therefore, it's extremely common for teams (usually your direct coworkers, sometimes people from other teams) to yell "MAHLZEIT" and then head out to get lunch together.</p>

      <p>I think for this reason, and for this reason alone, the HQ buildings of DTNA in Portland both have cafeterias.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>So this feeds into a couple other points on this list, and is a little long winded. So I'll try and make it brief:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work hours are tracked from clock-in to clock-out, even for salaried employees</li>
        <li>Within that clock-in and clock-out time, subtractions are made (in my building's case) for a 15-minute break and a 40-minute lunch</li>
        <li>Because of this, lunch time is time OFF THE CLOCK</li>
        <li>During lunch however, I have yet to sit with a coworker that has talked about anything other than work (unless I change the conversation)</li>
        <li>That being the case, I have no qualms sitting alone for lunch to actually get a break from work</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Fuck That!!! Why would I talk about work when I'm not on the clock? There are so many other things to chat about, either that or let me charge my lunch time. So stupid.</p>

      <p>Kinda got off track there, but yeah, I sit alone for lunch fairly often. Because of COVID, the chairs are super spread out, so even going to the cafeteria with a coworker I can barely hear someone from across the table aka room. So I'm fine sitting with myself, eating and then going back to work. I guess that is one thing keeping me from going full-German.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>This one's a bit hard to explain. You know how I mentioned the fervence of greeting everyone with good morning in the morning? Well, in every German's internal clocks, once the clock strikes 10:30, that 'good morning' changes to 'Mahlzeit', and changes to a mix of other things as soon as 14:00 hits.</p>

      <p>Literally translated, Mahlzeit means meal time.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>I think this utterance is even more prevalent, fervent, and present than Guten Morgen. And no joke, this is a socially acceptable (and expected) behavior that spans a roughly 3.5 hour window.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>My interaction this weird and unique phenomenon goes all the way back to my internship in Hamburg. I'd always bring lunch, and around lunch time I'd head to the small break room, plop down on my own (see above), and start eating. Not everyone there took lunch at the same time as me, but anyone who'd go up or down the hall would always pop their head in and always say the same thing, "Mahlzeit".</p>

      <p>It honestly confused the hell out of me. Mahlzeit. Meal time. Yes, I knew I was eating. That's why I had a sandwich in my hands. Was there really a need to remind me of this? It seemed so patently obvious that verbalizing the realization was extreme overkill. I never understood this.</p>

      <p>Until I talked to my then-boss, after I briefly inquired about it. Only then did I learn that this was a custom that made no sense to me.</p>

      <p>And ever since then, it has only grown in its prevalence in my daily life here. Then, I only experienced it right at the exact time I was eating. Now, it's a half-day long phenomenon. I don't know how this weird tradition came to be, how it seems to make sense in the minds of Germans, or how I can get away from it (I can't. It's everywhere.), but it's here, and I have to get used to it.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, for most non-Germans, and the laid-back Germans, it's a thing to laugh about and make fun of. But for everyone else, I don't think they know how unique and (imo) strange this habit is.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Here, maybe an hour might not be the right bar to set. But essentially it boils down to you did not use the full extent of your allotted lunch time. For example, our office has a 40 minute lunch break built into our time clock. So for me, this would boil down to me taking anything less than a 40 minute break for lunch.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Not sure how to speculate on this one. Maybe to two points. Following by the rules - if you're given a 40 minute break to eat your lunch, you use the 40 minute break to eat your lunch. The second point, well, again, I'm not really sure how to divulge on this other than it's just peer pressure and the social pressure to follow the herd.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Weirdly enough, I'm usually taking a quicker lunch break. For multiple reasons. But the main one is, why waste time sitting around if I'm done eating when I can go back to work and get something done. Kinda stupid to hold to a set time every day when you're guaranteed to have a different lunch experience every day with a little variety to change the timing and situation up. Go with the flow. Not that hard to do.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>There's a little nuance to throw into this one. Staying late can be a bit subjective due to how working contracts are set up. Every worker/employee/whatever has an hour amount that is tied to their contract dictating how many hours they're expected to work per week. For example, I have a 40-hour contract, a lot of my coworkers have 35-hour contracts, and they can vary.</p>

      <p>So if you work your standard daily hours (for me it's 8, for my coworkers it's 7), and then work a little bit over that amount, then no sweat.</p>

      <p>However... In Germany there is also a federal law that you are not legally allowed to work more than 10 hours in a day. So, if you work more than 10 hours in a day, that's where the whole legality of it all dissolves.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Experience from my group though, to be honest, no one gives a shit about those rules. Going above your daily hours just means more vacation. And going above the 10 hour limit, just means you don't clock out and fudge your hours on the time system to make it show that you didn't work over 10 hours. The law is there, people just work their way around it and are pretty unashamed about it.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I've done both. The working over 8 hours a day is a huge plus in the long run (sucks in the short because it's more of life wasted towards work), because that means I get just that much more vacation!!! In a real non-COVID world it'd be amazing. So I've been wracking up hours and saving for this summer HOPING I'll get the chance to travel and get the FUCK out of here.</p>

      <p>And yeah, on the 10 hour part, I've done that too.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>None needed.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Well, Germans are stereotypically classified as a timely bunch. That holds true in some areas of life and doesn't hold water in others. When it comes to work though, things are usually pretty punctual. If someone sets a meeting for a certain time, you're expected to be there ready to go at or before that time. I've got the assumption this is held to a higher standard at some business compared to others, but my impression is that this is a pretty common understanding and rule that people hold to.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>When it comes to meeting start times, this is pretty true. Usually people are there at (and in my experience actually a hair after) the time of a meeting start.</p>

      <p>Whether things hold to the designated end time of a meeting though, that's a whole other fucking world. I could go long on this one, but German's like to talk and discuss and go into detail. With that, if someone has a set amount of time alotted to their point, that is usually just a formality and that doesn't hold any weight in anything. My heavy impression on this aspect is a little biased based off of one monthly experience, but I digress...</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>This one does not fully make sense, as it (in my experience) is a bit of a mash-up of two different concepts. That, or my experience here is very non-typical. Either way, I'll break it down according to my understanding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stammtisch</strong> - this is essentially a meeting group of individuals that meet up regularly (weekly, monthly, whatever) at your local brewery, shoot the breeze, drink beer, and eat whatever hefty delicious cuisine the place is serving up. Due to the consistency of the meeting, these groups usually have their tables reserved well in advance (likely due to decades of consistently being there, same time, same place).<br>
        The reason I break this aspect out of the overall assertion is that Stammtisches (again, my experience) are derived from non-work groups. Sport clubs, activity groups, essentially groups of people (not based off of a work environment) that do things together will establish a Stammtisch. So rather than coworkers, it's your buddies and friends that you do ____ with after work or on the weekends.</li>
        <li><strong>Happy Hour Culture</strong> - this is what I'll refer to as the concept of going out to drinks with your coworkers. Could be a regular deal, could not. But this is what I'll break out as it's specifically work-focused or work-related, compared to a Stammtisch, which is not.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>From that, I consider there to be two categories, one work-related (Happy Hour) and one not-work-related (Stammtisch).</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Stammtisches appear from my exposure to be a very common part of life here in Germany, or even jusy a common part of a German's life. </p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>When it comes to Stammtisches, I've been to a Stammtisch for the local Mountain Biking group, one for German expats when I was in Portland, and maybe one or two others. It's a good time for people to meet, shoot the breeze, and connect on whatever was the topic/core of that group's Stammtisch.</p>

      <p>As for a semblance of a Happy Hour culture here in Germany, I have yet to see anything like that, which is a bummer. My work location probably plays a big role here, being isolated from any kind of restaurants or breweries or anything, along with all of my colleagues living in a very spread out proximity to work, so that doesn't provide a good opportunity to grab beers after work.</p>

      <p>My boss has tried to get our team to meet up after work for a drink, but it's only happened once, and it was planned a good month in advance, and even then it was only four of us. Not a popular concept.</p>

      <p>Expanding upon this, I'm reminded of a very fitting hypothesis that my amazing buddy Zack shared with me at some point. It goes something along these lines...</p>

      <p class="quote">If you can't have a beer with your coworkers, then they might not be good coworkers.</p>

      <p>I say that to provide a distinction. Just because my team/coworkers don't go out for drinks, really ever, does not mean that they wouldn't be fun to have a drink with. Beer culture is part of life itself over here, and all the folks I work around live up to that, as far as I've seen or experienced.</p>

      <p>The difference here I think is the difference of where I'm at in life compared to everyone I work around. Clarified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Me</strong> - 30, single, no kids, non-home owner, foreigner</li>
        <li><strong>My Coworkers (generalized)</strong> - mid-30s-60s, married/partnered, kids, home owner, local</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All that to say, I'm in a different life stage compared to most of my coworkers. Which is kind of a bummer, but that's how it is.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>For those that don't know, German's have a literal law on the books called the <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a>. This restricts/requires that anything that be sold as beer that has been brewed in Germany be made with only water, barley, and hops (and later added to that list, correct me if I'm wrong Ryan, yeast). Germans are very proud of this law and their pride of this law manifests itself into the importance of German beer in the German culture.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>The Rheinheitsgebot has, in my opinion, implanted a sense of entitlement and superiority for German's and their German beer. The concept that beer could possibly brewed with other items other than the strict limit of water, barley, hops, and yeast, is a foreign concept to them. Since it's inception in Bavaria in 1516 it's grown in implementation throughout the country and been held to pretty religiously.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As you might tell, I've got a serious bone to pick with German beer, and I'm not shy about it. There is NO/little variety here. Pilsners, Lagers, Wheats, and Black beers. Other than the wheat beers, they nearly all taste the same. Maybe that's due to my taste bud's, but I don't consider there to be any variety. Yes, every dorf has THEIR brewery. Woohoo. Doesn't help that Dorf 1 has a special pilsner that Dorf 2 somehow produces damn nearly the exact same thing just with a different name. This is a very poor comparison, but it kinda feels like beer inbreeding. You gotta mix up the population (brewing ingredients) to keep it good.</p>

      <p>In comparison, I could walk into nearly any bar or brewery in Portland and have to choose between a Lager, Pale Ale, IPA, Stout, Sour, Cider, Porter, Tripel, and who knows what else. Variety. Variety in taste, ingredients, color, intended flavor. Goddamn I miss that.</p>

      <p>Again, I've shared this view point a few times and I can't remember a time where a German conceded, or seriously acknowledged my point. For the whale's majority over here, German beer os best beer and there's no questioning that. And, in my opinion, that strong belief comes with either some pretty thick blinders, some very specific (not necessarily bland, but just very concentrated just on certain tastes) taste buds, some incredible cultural blind pride, or a mix of all of the above.</p>

      <p>The crux of this point was simply saying "American beer is good". I took this further than that, simply because I've got a bone to pick with German beer pretentiousness, and the fact that even if you say that, you'll likely get some quip back about how German beer is better. That's my biased view.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I think I've been on the staying-home end of this a time or two. I can be social, but sometimes I just don't want to do anything or get less-energetic feeling regarding what I'm about to go do. I feel like that's pretty universally human, right?</p>

      <p>I have been on the ghosted end of this a time or two. And yeah, it's not cool. Biggest example happened last Fall. I elected to host my fantasy football league over to watch the early NFL games on a Sunday night. About 6 people RSVP'd so I made sure to have enough beer and snacks at the house to be a good host and have a good time. Sunday night comes - not a single one shows up...</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Football (soccer) is the most popular sport here in Germany. I think by a landslide.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>I don't have enough exposure to this here to really provide some thoughtful commentary. I did some looking up on Wikipedia (apparently football/soccer is more universally known as <a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">Association Football</a>?), and it appears the earliest form of soccer (known) occurred in China. The game then was called "cuju" literally "kick ball". Then in Europe. the most prevalent origin of the sport stems from England.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Don't have much in terms of soccer origin discussions with Germans, so my experience here is pretty limited to just watching soccer either in a stadium, a bar, or on the couch.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>German bread is a staple of the culinary culture over here, similar to beer. There has actually been a push to enshrine <a class="body" href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-bread-vies-for-unesco-recognition/a-17456446">German Bread in the UNESCO registry as an Intangible Cultural Heritage</a>.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Talking to people about bread, this pride is pretty evident. Backeries are on nearly every corner here, all grocery stores seem to have a separate backery also attached to it, and those backeries are working full force every day to make sure everyone has their specific type of bread at the ready.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of your typical German breads. For me, they're too dense, dry, and brittle. Other types of breads, however, I find delicious. Laugenbrot, which is essentially if pretzel dough was used for bread rolls and loafs, is absolutely delicious. Some of the bread rolls that are so popular are ok, but for the most part the crust is to crumby and brittle for me.</p>

      <p>I have also found a loaf type that I like. It's at the Rewe near mean, and I don't know what distinguishes it from its dense and dry counterparts, but the Winzerbrot loaf that I stumbled upon turned out to be pretty good. Moist, a little airy but not too much, and sturdy enough for sammiches. A good quality bread, finally.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>I don't know how true this is, but butter is a very, if not the most common, cooking ingredient over here. That, and it's common to find that as the most common spreading ingredient in German bakeries or at a typical German breakfast.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Because I perceive that as the most common, and I see it pretty much everywhere, I think that's the reason for the heavy weight put on butter. For instance, in bakeries, a common item to see is your standard beer pretzel, but cut in half and with butter spread on each half, then smashed back together. It's called, you guess it, a butter prezel.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>My difficulties with butter when I have the chance to spread it, is that it's usually still frozen or brick-like, so I don't have any easy chance of spreading it. Sometimes I'm able to skillfully skim off a layer for my use, but sometimes it comes it a glob and there's not much I can do with it til it melts. I have not, however, slapped a 1cm thick layer of butter on anything and then directly consumed it. That just sounds too gluttonous and unhealthy.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>German is home to Das Auto. I work for the company that stems from the guy who invented the automobile - Karl Benz. So to say that Germans are proud of their cars and motor vehicles, and by extension, how they are driven, is an understatement.</p>

      <p>The sentiment that manual transmissions are a more raw, in-tune, or original way to drive a car I think is a pretty common sentiment or opinion, however, and not specific to Germany.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Mercedes, Porsche, Volkswagen, BMW, all German auto manufacturers. As with most things in life, the car is a point of pride about Germans. A bit extrapolated, but that's why people go fucking apeshit as soon as someone mentions putting speed limits on all the unlimited sectionso of the Autobahn.</p>

      <p>Well, as mentioned above, the point that driving a stick shift is the 'only true' way to drive is also a fairly commonly held opinion here in Germany too. The weird thing is though, almost all new cars are NOT sold as a stick shift. So, for example, all the people at Daimler that get a leased car through work are not driving stick shifts, because Mercedes doesn't make any cars with a manual transmission any more. Unless maybe some special AMG model, but your standard cars aren't offered with a stick shift anymore. So slowly, although this sentiment is still prevalent and popular, auto manufacturers by force are starting to make it harder and harder to drive a manual transmission car.

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>In my adult life, I have only ever owned a stick shift. Mostly be happenstance, but I'm pretty damn happy about it. It's definitely more fun to drive a stick, as it's a more engaging and inter experience. I'm also one who likes control in the things I do, and this is perfectly inline with that - I control when the car goes into what gear.</p>

      <p>My (now former) 2000 Ford Focus, Marvin, was a sturdy little stick shift. He was powerful enough to get me all over the place and was fun to drive. Unfortunately though, he was recently donated, as nothing worked anymore - wouldn't turn over, wouldn't start, animals living in it, sad to see my trusty buddy go. But once I got over to Germany I had to pick up a car and was able to find Rupert, my 2014 Volkwagen Golf wagon who also has a stick shift. Thankfully it's worked out for me that I've always owned manual transmissions, but who knows when that might change.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>In Germany, shopping carts aren't immediately available to just anyone who wants them. Rather, all shopping carts (or most, essentially at any retail chain) are locked together in the shopping cart areas. And they're not locked together so that no one can use them, but locked together sequetially, and that lock is able to be undone if a token (usually a 0.50€ or 1€ coin) is inserted into the slot to release them.</p>

      <p>Therefore, whenever you're going grocery shopping, you need to have a coin or token that fits in that slot handy in order to have access to a shopping cart.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Every German seems to know that this is the case whenever go shopping. It helps that Germany is still almost completely a cash-based society. So for most people, it's not that hard to pull out your coin purse, shuffle around for a 0.50€ or 1€ coin and stick it in the slot. Pretty handy when you are pretty much guaranteed to have the necessary item already on your person.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>For those of us that aren't Germany and aren't stuck on a cash-only worldview, sometimes this can be a challenge to always have a coin on hand. I've forgotten one plenty of times and have had to then just rely on the bags I've brought with to schleep all my stuff around.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, thanks to Hornbach the local hardware store, I've stumbled upon the perfect answer to this problem. At some point early on in the Corona pandemic, as we were still able to do things in life, Hornbach was handing out little tokens that are the exactly correct size to fit in these little coin slots! So I snagged a couple of them and have them handy in the right spots. One is always situated in the little tray in my car next to the parking brake in Rupert! That way, any time I'm going grocery shopping, all I need to do is snag my little token and I'm golden! Weird cultural norm thwarted! MWAHAHAHAHA!!!</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>As mentioned before, bread is a very popular and dearly-held thing here in Germany. Most people go to their local bakery to buy their bread. But, groceries still have a bakery (most of them, at least). As with bakeries in grocery stores in the states (as far as I remember), there are little bread slicing machines near the bakery so you can slice up your full loaf all in one fell swoop. Pretty handy thing.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Because bread is a holy thing here, by natural extension, anything that has to do with bread is then holy as well. Well, I have never used a bread-slicing machine at my local grocery store over here. But here's how I think it would go down if you were to find yourself in the unfortunate situation of having clogged it up.</p>

      <p>You go to the counter and acquire your treasured loaf of wheat and German pride and unfortunately the counter doesn't have the option to stick it into a slicing machine behind the counter. So you are relegated to complete this task on your own. Undaunted and ready to receive the precisely same width of slices through this wonder of technology, you waddle over there and get to work.</p>

      <p>The place to put the bread is fairly clear, so you stick your loaf in and hope it's in the precisely correct orientation and has the right heritage (I'll be damned if I've got a loaf of something Schwäbian in there... thinks the Baden), and with your thumbs very tightly squeezed, you press the green button, click ok, sign the required release form, sign the form you need to fax to the headquarters (signing includes Current City, Date, and Signature), and then press the green button. The machine starts to hum.</p>

      <p>And then it doesn't anymore. Leck mich fett... You were worried about this, but here we go. You open up the bread entry container and out of the corner of your eye you see an Oma just reaching over the counter for her loaf of bread and your eyes meet. That supreme disdain only a German Oma can portray is evident as she immediately recognizes you are what is standing in the way between her and a freshly, pristinely sliced loaf of bread. Sweat can not restrain itself once you realize the impending evil-eye coming your way.</p>

      <p>No time to be chaotic, you tackle the problem like a good German - slowly, methodically, and fully verified in your investigation before you take any action. But nothing looks to be askew. All the diagrams on the machine match exactly with what you did. The logic of the situation seems off, and you don't know what to do. Unfortunately, by this time, Oma is right next to you, visibly irritated, on the verge of continuing her passive-aggressive disdain for your idiocy. Tension and stress builds.</p>

      <p>The lady behind the bakery counter sees you and immediately scurries away. You can't blame her for not wanting to be a part of this blood bath, but damn you could use some help right now.</p>

      <p>Re-reading the required procedure step-by-step to run this blöd machine for the eight time, you notice a verb preposition, that you assumed was one thing, is in fact not that thing. Thanks to the weird way that you don't get the full information of a sentence until the period, you went too fast through it all the first time and missed a crucial piece of information.</p>

      <p>Oma is ready to ram you with her shopping cart by this time, but you know what you need to do. Jammed loaf of bread in hand, you re-orient it 20degrees around the Z-Axis, pat it three times, press it lightly into the feed, and poof, it works. Scurrying to GTFO of there as fast as possible, you lose all sense of Germanness and throw all the slices into the bag and get the heck out of dodge before the Oma's passive-aggressiveness morphs to angry muttering...</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As I said, I have never used a bread-slicing machine here in Germany. That's mostly because I'm normally not the biggest fan of your typical german bread types, and just opt to stay secure and content in my own world of 'shitty' (a german's description) American-style sliced bread. They can go fuck themselves with their judgement though, because that American-style bread actually has some strength to it so I can make an actual sandwich and not have the shitty German-style bread just fall apart trying to pick the damn thing up. Functional my ass...</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>In most cultures, standing in line is a pretty prevalent. At the grocery store, you line up at the check out counter or at the bakery. In a train station, you line up to get tickets or to board the train. Most people I know know of this concept, and hold to it pretty well.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>In Germany, the CONCEPT of standing in line is known. However the PRACTICE has been purposefully thrown out the door because no one here actually gives a fuck about other people when it comes to getting to whatever that line leads to.</p>

      <p>It is seriously a wonder to me how the country and its people that are known for order, efficiency, and process (all of which are stereotypes that are in this day and age <a class="body" href="https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-covid-19-challenges-german-efficiency-cliche/a-56816585">not even close to accurate anymore...</a>) suddenly lose all sense of humanity and civility as soon as they have to wait for something.</p>

      <p>I've honestly got no idea how this mentality and lack of civility has come to be prevlant with the presence of a line or a queue. This does not jive with a lot of behaviors you can observe from German's on the street, such as when someone doesn't follow simple societal rules (eating/talking too loud on the subway, walking on the bike lane, crossing the street on a red light), that perpetrator gets nothing stink eye and condemnation from everyone that is witness.</p>

      <p>But when it comes to waiting in line, either some kind of exception has been made for this behavior, or people's mentalities just go full caveman as soon as they have to wait.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>It honestly blows my mind how people become so rude and uncivilized as soon as a line pops up. Maybe it just pisses me off so much because I appreciate order, and it pisses me the fuck off when people try to cut me or not recognize my position in a line, for example. But somehow people just assume it's no-holds-barred as soon as a queue materializes.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Germany is all about processes. Namely, processes with many steps, most of which that aren't clear, and are full of (in a modern era) lots of complications. Pair that with the fact that Germany is still not a digital country, and most processes usually include their fair share of paper forms that must be filled out to get through with any process.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Whether it be for something government-related, something work-related, or something else, paperwork and forms are a basic part of life in Germany. Case in point:</p>

      <p class="quote">Von der Wiege bis zur Wahre, Formulare, Formulare!<br>
        From the scale to the gurney, Forms, Forms!</p>

      <p>Another one I've heard, it's more of a retort than a saying, but to the effect of, "Oh yeah, there's a form required in order to fill out that form". Forms are engrained into society here.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Bad. Forms everywhere. Most of the times they come out of nowhere and you only learn about them when the person supposed to help you throws you a shitty look and says they can't help you because you forgot to fill out one specific form that is NOWHERE else to be found. Bureaucracy is king here and forms are it's sword of death.</p>

      <p>In typing all this up, I unfortunately can't think of a specific example. Either because it was minor, or because I was so blinded with rage by the circumstance that I did my best to forget about it. Those instances have come up more often than not when dealing with the official processes, especially regarding my drivers license.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Even before Corona Times, airing out the office space, or really any room or building, was an integral and expected procedure that should be performed regularly. Why is this? Well it is extremely rare to find a building here that has air conditioning. Not sure if the lack of A/C led to the regular practice of airing buildings and rooms out, but either way, airing out spaces is a common thing to do here. Also, what's wrong with a little fresh air? :-)</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Well, with the uptick of Corona virus, the fact that Germany has not invested in the energy-hog we in the rest of the western world love as A/C, and the fact that airing buildings out seems to be engrained in people's heads, it's still quite a thing here. Not sure if there's anything more 'culturally' to say about it.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I've got a bit of a love-hate with this. I'll start with the hate. My desk at work sits right next to a door that is used quite often with people coming in and out to get access to our test trucks and generally come and go. Well, the shitty thing about that door is that there's no badge reader at the door, so people will chalk it open so they can come and go with ease.</p>

      <p>We're slowly getting out of winter, and although it's cold out, that didn't stop people from propping open the door. Because of that, and my proximity to it, I always had a pretty steady stream of cold air blowing my way, and since cold air sinks, it went straight for my legs and my cold sweaty feet. That led to nothing but discomfort that even a stand heater and make-shift wall to block off the air and seal in my cubicle didn't quite help. Probably would be ok if it weren't for my damn shitty feet.</p>

      <p>Now the love part, that's something we're slowly rolling back into. Warm temperatures mean throw those windows open and let that fresh breeze blow on through. At home, I'm all about it. I'll close the shutters during the day on the south side to prevent the blazing sun from turning my place into a total sauna, but the north-side windows are open constantly. No joke, I think my three windows on the north side were open to some degree (either tilted or fully open - the lovliness of German windows) for a good at least three months. Gloriously refreshing.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>The German language is a little special and deviates in a number of ways from my mother tongue. One of those ways are forms of address. In English, we have one form of address - you. It's both formal and informal and the most direct way of addressing someone. Well, in German there's a split - both an official/formal way (Sie), and a familiar/informal way (Du). This also leads to a difference in conjugation (-t vs. -st) and change in particle (Ihr vs. dein). It's so engrained, that there are separate and specific verbs to describe these veins of speech (duzen - to DU someone; siezen - to SIE someone).</p>

      <p>The reason being for this (as I've learned and experienced it) is a sign of respect. You use the Sie form as a sign of respect to elders, authorities, and people above you in hierarchy. It's both a means of clarifying where the two ends of a converstation fit on the totem pole, and exuding respect or lack of familiarity at the same time.</p>

      <p>No worries if that's all just text, just know that this impacts sentence structure and word choice quite a bit. And for someone that does not grow up learning a language with such a characteristic, it is quite tricky.</p>

      <p>The closest comparison I can think of to English would be using a Mr./Mrs. title compared to a first name. You know when you address someone for a long time as Mr./Mrs. So-and-so, and then they say, "Aw, you can address me by <em>FirstName</em>." In the Mr./Mrs. stage you're comparably in the 'Sie' stage, and the FirstName stage is the 'Du' stage. Not a direct comparison, but it's as close as we can get in the English language.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>This difference is especially present in a work environment. As a rule, you use the Sie (formal) form to superiors and new colleagues or contacts, where as with your close colleagues, teammates, and friends, you use Du (informal). For those that you Sie, there usually comes a point where one member or the other will broach the subject and be like "Hey, let's Du, sound good?". But for some people, honestly most typically older Germans or less-open people (imo), will firmly hold by their being addressed with Sie.</p>

      <p>This honestly plays a pretty big role in most communication form. For ads and such, there's a slow trend that you can see the general public being addressed with the Du/dein or Ihr/euer (which is like you all, like Ustedes in Spanish) forms, instead of the Sie/Ihr formal address forms. This is usually by newer, more progressive, or more relaxed/open-minded groups.</p>

      <p>For example, all of my bank forms that come in the mail (yep, they're still so stone age that they don't have a paperless option, despite being a very 'eco-conscious' culture), I'm addressed with the Sie/Ihr form.</p>

      <p>I haven't read much legal text over here (THANK GOD), but I'm pretty sure either the Sie/Ihr formal form is used as a legal address of the general public or people, or it's done a bit differently where instead of using a direct you address it's formulated to say one, but even then that's a little weird and honestly a bit sexist because of the following comparison:</p>

      <p class="quote">Example - ENGLISH - You can not do that<br>
        Example - ENGLISH - One cannot do that<br>
        Example - GERMAN - Man darf das nicht machen (literally, Man can not do that)</p>

      <p>So that goes into a different topic, but all in all, language is a bit more intricate and engrained into various parts of life than what I'm used to.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p><strong>Utilization</strong><br>
        For me, this duzen and siezen shift (it's honestly a switch in the brain and a mentality shift for me) is doable, but a little tiring and requires a good bit of effort. I'd say that my German proficiency was developed in a non-work, informal environment. Because of that, my primary experience is with the informal/familiar form. Getting so comfortable with the familiar form for my addresses, verb conjugations, particles, and overall sentence structure has come with practice. But, when you practice just one thing so often and don't utilize the other nearly as often, naturally, the other is a little weaker.
      </p>

      <p>Because of that, when I'm in a situation where I should be Sie'ing someone, I have to think a little harder on what all needs to be modified, adjusted, changed, and conjugated to switch over to that form. I much appreiciate it when I'm able to utilize it in an email so I can be sure to double check it and go a little slower without issue to get everything correct. When I have to verbally address people with Sie though, that's when it gets a little tougher. It's not impossible. I know I'm not great at it, but I know I can do it moderately well without making a total ass of myself.</p>

      <p><strong>Means of Respect</strong>
        <br>Now the other aspect is the form of address as a vehicle of showing respect or familiarity to someone. This could be due to my background in believing that respect is never given - it must be earned. It could be that I think respect is more clearly shown in a plethora of other ways, such as tone of voice, body language, interaction, intrisic understanding of respect and how you handle yourself, and any other number of things related to the interaction at hand. It could be due to my stubbornness in not wanting to do what is expected of me. It could be because I'm better at 'Du'ing people. But for me, I think utilizing the Sie as a means of firm and required method of showing respect to someone as old-fashioned, a bit out-dated, and in some cases, downright undeserved.</p>

      <p>As I said before, and I think respect should be earned and never just straight-up given. Just because someone has a higher rank than me, does not mean they have earned or are due my respect. That doesn't mean that people start out with me getting zero respect and have to earn every bit, but that there is a base level of respect I (try to) give to everyone, and the ones that deserve more show that they're worth giving it to.</p>

      <p>To the more prescient point though, that respect can be shown in any number of other ways, this I think is something that may be not necessarily present in people's minds here. This could be totally bogus and my observational skills are complete bogus - very much in the realm of possibilty. But I get the feeling that simply using the formal form of address could give people the feeling that they've provided enough respect through that method and that they can be dicks elsewhere. Again, this may be a very un-founded feeling, or maybe just an extrapolation of a feeling.</p>

      <p>For me, the requirement or status of having to 'Sie' someone leaves an impression of dislike or distate. Kinda like you're always keeping someone at arms-length. This fits to a few German stereotypes, but for me, that's not how I live life. Granted, there are some people that I don't necessarily see myself getting close with or interacting with a ton to be best friends, but my opinion is, I can still treat them with a familiar tone. They're humans, I'm human, we're all in this together.</p>

      <p><strong>Foreigner Card</strong><br>
        I'll give you an example of something I'm going through. So my department head (E3, level) has been extremely cordial and friendly with me since I've got here. When he's in our building, he's sure to stop by and have a little small talk, which I appreciate. I don't know how we got there (likely a previous mind-slip or laziness from me), but we've always interacted on a 'Du' level.</p>

      <p>For most of my colleagues in my same department, this is NOT the same experience. Nearly all of them still "Sie" with our E3, and pretty consistently to a person. Similar level as me, but they have a more formal form of address with the same person. And this is a singular example, but appartenly our E3 holds to this form of formal/official address pretty strictly.</p>

      <p>There was a rotational colleague in our department, and I can't remember how it came up, but she always 'Sie'd with our E3, but either slipped up or assumed a change in status and 'Du'd the E3. Well, this was shut down VERY quickly with a (not direct quotation), "Sie, please". Which essentially both a slap in the face and a firm reprimand. Not a good feeling.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>This is surprisingly a different title to the 'Du' vs. 'Sie' topic. But by Title (<a class="body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_honorifics">or more accurately, Honorifics</a>), things like Doctor, Professor, etc. in addition to the Mr./Mrs. in a person's address are very important when addressing people.</p>

      <p>As an example, let's take the address of the lovely Mutti Merkel, Angela Merkel into account. So, she is a woman (Frau), a recipient of a Doctorate Degree (Doktor, no -in because idk), and a chancellor (Kanzlerin, -in because it's a female modification of the word). With all that combined, her title would then be:</p>

      <p class="quote">Frau Doktor Kanzlerin Merkel</p>

      <p>That's a fairly tame example. More tame and more common is to interact with doctors as (example, my dentist) "Herr Doktor Weiland".

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Depending on which circles you hob-nob with, it's not necessarily a given that someone has multiple titles. And depending on the person, some people are more protective and expectant of the correct utilization of their titles than others.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Apparently, if I were in Austria, I could be addresses as "Herr Magister Ingenieur Tilson". Dope to know I've got a little clout in front of my name. But I'm not a stuck up douche so I would never use that. Seems way to damn pretentious to me.</p>
