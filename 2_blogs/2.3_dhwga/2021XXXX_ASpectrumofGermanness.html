    <h1>A SPECTRUM OF GERMANNNESS</h1>
    <br>

    <p><strong>It's not Good, it's not Bad, it's just Different</strong></p>

    <p>I recently sent a pop-quiz to my friends from my CBYX years in our group chat, asking them to guess something I recently did (explanation to come). To my amazement and enjoyment, their answers became something way more than a direct reply, but a wonderfully hilarious opportunity for some self-analysis, cultural commentary, and some fun to take a look at life over here and how it is seen through an American lens.</p>

    <p><strong>The Question:</strong>  Nial just broke two major German labor laws within the past 24 hours. What were they?</p>

    <p><strong>The Replies:</strong>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="background:none; font-size:1em;">You said "nein" when someone offered you a beer</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Is this illegal in Germany? No</p>
      <p>Is it frowned upon? Eh, kinda? Not really, but depends</p>
      <p>Have I seen Germans do this? Of course</p>
      <p>Have I done this? Absolutely</p>
