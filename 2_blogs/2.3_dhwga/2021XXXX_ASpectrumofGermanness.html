    <h1>A SPECTRUM OF GERMANNNESS</h1>

    <p style="text-align:center"><strong>It's not Good, it's not Bad, it's just Different</strong></p>

    <p>I recently sent a pop-quiz to my friends from my CBYX years in our group chat, asking them to guess something I recently did (explanation to come). To my amazement and enjoyment, their answers were way more than a direct reply.</p>

    <p>Every answer and the information, memories, feelings, and all behind them put a smile on my face and brought back countless experiences and memories from my times here in Germany. Rather than just spit back an answer, I figured this is a wonderfully hilarious opportunity for some self-analysis, cultural commentary, and some fun to take a look at life over here and how it is seen through an American lens.</p>

    <p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

    <p>Nial just broke two major German labor laws within the past 24 hours. What were they?</p>

    <p><strong>The Replies:</strong></p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Beer / Bier is very important here in Germany. I don't think that's a secret in any way, shape, or form. And not just the substance itself, but the culture of beer is also very important.</p>

      <p>Naturally, peer pressure exists, so when one person gets a beer, that usually means everyone else is taking part in the next round as well. Though it is a thing of peer pressure, doesn't mean people aren't able to bow out and stop or skip a round.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Of late, I've definitely been drinking less, less beer at least. In the few times I've been around others, I've received no pushback or sarcasm for skipping a beer or a round. Granted, those have all been low-key situations, and no pressure like at a sports game or some kind of festival. But no sweat here.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Aldi is a popular grocery store chain, but this info involves any retail store, as all/most retail stores require customers to bag their own items.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>You receive a new, tangible understanding of stress when you're sitting at the end of the register, your things are loading up as the cashier shovels them through the scanner in record pace, and you're just getting your grocery bags up to re-assemble your newly-bought wares as the Oma (grandma) behind you stares aggressively at you as she pushes her two items down the belt.</p>

      <p>No joke, this shit is stressful. So, in the instance where you get behind on your bagging responsibilities, you start getting the stink eye from everyone in the line behind you. It sucks, it's intimidating, and it's just a situation of compounding stress.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I've had my share of times getting behind the belt, as they say (they don't it, it just sounds good). BUT, I've recently evolved in my grocery shopping habits. To be honest, I also have non-German grocery shopping habits, as in I grocery shopping about once every two weeks rather than every other day, so I usually get a lot of stuff.</p>

      <p>To save me the hassle of that stress with mounds of groceries (compounded on the need to structurally soundly pack the bags), I just throw everything back in the shopping car and am able to nicely, slowly, and orderly pack my grocery bags into the trunk of my car. Now that's what I call cheating the system.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>There's a saying in German for escalators - "Rechts stehen, links gehen" which means "Stand on the right, walk on the left". This applies directly to escalators, but also to other forms of transportation where the faster party is supposed to be on the left (for example, it's illegal to pass on the right on the Autobahn). So, in an escalator setting, people that stand still on the steps stand on the right side, and people that walk up the steps walk on the left side.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>To be honest, back in the times where I participated in the public transport system here, it pissed me off how many people lived their lives in such a fairy world. Though it socially frowned upon to do so, lots of people don't pay attentio to the unwritten rule and stand on the left.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>And when people do stand on the left, it pisses me off, because I'm one that doesn't like to let the slow motion of an escalator dictate my speed in life.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Bike lanes are not a foreign concept to most westerners. But, especially for Americans, treating bike lanes only as bike lanes IS a foreign concept to Americans. In Germany, things are a little more stringent and strict. If you're a bicyclist, stay in the bike lane. If you're not, GTFO.</p>

      <p>Cherry-picked for sure, but here's an example of America's attention towards bike lanes.</p>

      <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/3nqMqCc.jpg" alt="US Bike Laneage"></img>

      <p>In Germany though, I've got a feeling that overall bicycle education and handling is a part of the plethora of things parents and society are required to teach kids over here. Granted, bike riding is a much more integrated part into your average German/European's lives, so knowing how to not be an idiot around them makes a big difference.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Not much to say here, I don't think. German's are just taught at an early age to actually follow the signs regarding bikes. I'm a fan of it, as usually it means that bikes are where bikes are supposed to be. My only pet peeve with all of that is on average, German bicyclists are fucking slow.</p>

      <p>Here, there are also many shades of bike lanes. Some are the kind I recognized, thick white lane lines on the street. Soem are separate paths near the street. But there's also a flavor that throws newbies for a loop, the different colored pavers/bricks on teh sidewalk. This kind is just integrated into the sidewalk and can be easy to lose track of or recognize.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As much as it annoys me when people are walking in the bike lane, I have yes done it myself a time or two. Sometimes you space out, sometimes you don't realize there's a bike lane there.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Germans love their (3 kinds of) beer. A lot. German's also work, but those are not allowed to be mixed. Especially from my knowledge, in any of the places I've worked here in Germany, alcohol has been strictly forbidden.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Yes, beer is verboten at work, and yes Germany is big on beer, but weirdly enough I've yet to experience a clear mix of beer and work. My comparison here is grabbing beers with coworkers after work. I've yet to really experience that here.</p>

      <p>Granted, everything I say regarding this year has been extremely influenced by COVID, so it's likely my experience this go'round is not the standard experience, per se. Also, my workplace makes that a little difficult. We're not anywhere close to a town or dorf or any kind of civilization and most all of the people that work there (including my team) live anywhere within a 30-50 mile radius. So those conditions aren't ripe for post-work beers.</p>

      <p>My boss has mentioned it to me a couple of times though, but even in his experience, happy hour with your coworkers is a seemingly foreign concept here. Honestly, lacking that kind of camaraderie has been quite the bummer.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>As with anything, rules are meant to be broken. Despite beer being VERBOTEN at work, I've had the opportunity to enjoy one real and one non-alcoholic beer (two separate occasions) at work over here. Those are the only details you get. But, that does not meet the proscribed 2-beer norm as mentioned above. Hence the "No".</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Preeeeeeeeeeeeety self-explanatory here.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Here, it doesn't mean a damn thing who you are, who you know, or where you work. If you walk into a room and it's the morning time, it's like you are socially required to say good morning. Can't say how many times some random person has walked by, I have no fucking clue who it is, but I get a cheery good morning from them.</p>

      <p>Strangely, this isn't just localized to good mornings, but with any kind of greeting. Good morning is just the most prominent under this vein of thought.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Maybe I'm just not the cheery kind, or maybe I just find it weird, or maybe I find it a little overkill to expend that kind of energy on absolutely everyone I cross paths with in the morning.</p>

      <p>As a specific example of this, I'm on really good terms with one of my coworkers named Paul. We always give each other the stink-eye in jest, but spirits are high when we're in contact. Well one day, I walked into the office in the morning on my headphones tuning into a meeting. I just kinda blazed through and got to my desk as I was on a call. Well, later in the day, Paul gave me a real stink-eye and stink-face, and I asked him way. Slightly in jest, but I think a good amount of seriousness, he called me the "Arrogant American" because I didn't tell him good morning.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Fairly dissimilar to most workplaces in the US, most German workplaces have a Kantine (cafeteria) somewhere in the building. Even for smaller workplaces in a big office building, the building usually has a place that all tenants (and sometimes the public) can eat at. Therefore, it's extremely common for teams (usually your direct coworkers, sometimes people from other teams) to yell "MAHLZEIT" and then head out to get lunch together.</p>

      <p>I think for this reason, and for this reason alone, the HQ buildings of DTNA in Portland both have cafeterias.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>So this feeds into a couple other points on this list, and is a little long winded. So I'll try and make it brief:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work hours are tracked from clock-in to clock-out, even for salaried employees</li>
        <li>Within that clock-in and clock-out time, subtractions are made (in my building's case) for a 15-minute break and a 40-minute lunch</li>
        <li>Because of this, lunch time is time OFF THE CLOCK</li>
        <li>During lunch however, I have yet to sit with a coworker that has talked about anything other than work (unless I change the conversation)</li>
        <li>That being the case, I have no qualms sitting alone for lunch to actually get a break from work</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Fuck That!!! Why would I talk about work when I'm not on the clock? There are so many other things to chat about, either that or let me charge my lunch time. So stupid.</p>

      <p>Kinda got off track there, but yeah, I sit alone for lunch fairly often. Because of COVID, the chairs are super spread out, so even going to the cafeteria with a coworker I can barely hear someone from across the table aka room. So I'm fine sitting with myself, eating and then going back to work. I guess that is one thing keeping me from going full-German.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>This one's a bit hard to explain. You know how I mentioned the fervence of greeting everyone with good morning in the morning? Well, in every German's internal clocks, once the clock strikes 10:30, that 'good morning' changes to 'Mahlzeit', and changes to a mix of other things as soon as 14:00 hits.</p>

      <p>Literally translated, Mahlzeit means meal time.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>I think this utterance is even more prevalent, fervent, and present than Guten Morgen. And no joke, this is a socially acceptable (and expected) behavior that spans a roughly 3.5 hour window.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>My interaction this weird and unique phenomenon goes all the way back to my internship in Hamburg. I'd always bring lunch, and around lunch time I'd head to the small break room, plop down on my own (see above), and start eating. Not everyone there took lunch at the same time as me, but anyone who'd go up or down the hall would always pop their head in and always say the same thing, "Mahlzeit".</p>

      <p>It honestly confused the hell out of me. Mahlzeit. Meal time. Yes, I knew I was eating. That's why I had a sandwich in my hands. Was there really a need to remind me of this? It seemed so patently obvious that verbalizing the realization was extreme overkill. I never understood this.</p>

      <p>Until I talked to my then-boss, after I briefly inquired about it. Only then did I learn that this was a custom that made no sense to me.</p>

      <p>And ever since then, it has only grown in its prevalence in my daily life here. Then, I only experienced it right at the exact time I was eating. Now, it's a half-day long phenomenon. I don't know how this weird tradition came to be, how it seems to make sense in the minds of Germans, or how I can get away from it (I can't. It's everywhere.), but it's here, and I have to get used to it.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, for most non-Germans, and the laid-back Germans, it's a thing to laugh about and make fun of. But for everyone else, I don't think they know how unique and (imo) strange this habit is.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>Here, maybe an hour might not be the right bar to set. But essentially it boils down to you did not use the full extent of your allotted lunch time. For example, our office has a 40 minute lunch break built into our time clock. So for me, this would boil down to me taking anything less than a 40 minute break for lunch.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Not sure how to speculate on this one. Maybe to two points. Following by the rules - if you're given a 40 minute break to eat your lunch, you use the 40 minute break to eat your lunch. The second point, well, again, I'm not really sure how to divulge on this other than it's just peer pressure and the social pressure to follow the herd.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>Weirdly enough, I'm usually taking a quicker lunch break. For multiple reasons. But the main one is, why waste time sitting around if I'm done eating when I can go back to work and get something done. Kinda stupid to hold to a set time every day when you're guaranteed to have a different lunch experience every day with a little variety to change the timing and situation up. Go with the flow. Not that hard to do.</p>

      <h3>Background Info</h3>

      <p>There's a little nuance to throw into this one. Staying late can be a bit subjective due to how working contracts are set up. Every worker/employee/whatever has an hour amount that is tied to their contract dictating how many hours they're expected to work per week. For example, I have a 40-hour contract, a lot of my coworkers have 35-hour contracts, and they can vary.</p>

      <p>So if you work your standard daily hours (for me it's 8, for my coworkers it's 7), and then work a little bit over that amount, then no sweat.</p>

      <p>However... In Germany there is also a federal law that you are not legally allowed to work more than 10 hours in a day. So, if you work more than 10 hours in a day, that's where the whole legality of it all dissolves.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Commentary</h3>

      <p>Experience from my group though, to be honest, no one gives a shit about those rules. Going above your daily hours just means more vacation. And going above the 10 hour limit, just means you don't clock out and fudge your hours on the time system to make it show that you didn't work over 10 hours. The law is there, people just work their way around it and are pretty unashamed about it.</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>

      <p>I've done both. The working over 8 hours a day is a huge plus in the long run (sucks in the short because it's more of life wasted towards work), because that means I get just that much more vacation!!! In a real non-COVID world it'd be amazing. So I've been wracking up hours and saving for this summer HOPING I'll get the chance to travel and get the FUCK out of here.</p>

      <p>And yeah, on the 10 hour part, I've done that too.</p>
