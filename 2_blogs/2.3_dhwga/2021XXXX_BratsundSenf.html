    <p>Get it? It's like saying "Life ain't all about roses and sunshine" but I germanified it.</p>

    <p>Impeccably articulate prose aside, the saying holds. Life ain't all sunshine and roses. And that definitely holds true in my life.</p>

    <p>To be honest, I've started to really struggle with being in Germany over the last couple of months. There's a lot that plays into this, and I'm going to take this opportunity for me to do a bit of a brain dump and lay out my thoughts to help me process my mindset and experience thus far. It'll probably be pretty personal, and we'll see how much I'm willing to lay it all bare, but I hope this gives a bit more of an insight into my life - in general and specific to being over here.</p>

    <h3>DISCLAIMERS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This is not necessarily going to be a cohensive stream of thoughts, but moresoe a chaotic flow of rambling</li>
      <li>There's gonna be some ups with the downs, and likely just a big collection of thoughts and musings I've been wanting to touch on for a while</li>
      <li>Unlike most of my other posts, this is gonna be a lot of words and not a lot of pictures. Not my style, but everyone's gotta brain-dump at some point</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With that, here goes...</p>

    <h2>Work Struggles</h2>

    <p>Let's get work out of the way first. Overall, work is going ok over here. I've got a good manager, working with a bunch of really experienced and competent people (and a few that aren't either), and the project is moving along ok.</p>

    <p>Considering the fact that work is really the only thing able to go on in life right now, it's also kind of a bummer that I'm not really enjoying what I'm doing. I think that can be boiled to a number of reasons, and it's a bit scattered and compounding.</p>

    <h3 id="Colleagues">Colleagues</h3>

    <p>Something I learned in my last job is that it's not about what you do day to day, but who you work with. The people you work with and interact with make such a huge difference and have such a massive impact on the ability to enjoy what you do.</p>

    <p>The folks on my team are extremely competent, experienced, and really good at what they do. Additionally, I'd be more than happy to grab a beer with them all, aka I get along with all of them pretty well (going back to Zack's hypothesis, which has so far proven pretty true in my life, that if you coworkers aren't the type of people you'd want to go grab a beer with, they're likely not great coworkers). The ability to interact and cooperate and work together and tolerate each other is definitely not the problem.</p>

    <p>The downside is that a) the culture here isn't like what I'm used to in the US where you do something outside of work together every now and then or try to foster some kind of non-work interactions if the interest is there, and more prevalent is b) that all of my coworkers are in a different life stage than me.</p>

    <p>The reason I think this is so prominent for me is the fact that I don't have the ability to do much of anything outside of work. Since my main inter-personal interactions are all work-related, it's a bummer that I don't have the chance to connect with my colleagues on a more enjoyable, not-work-related level. Granted, COVID obviously has been and continues to be a big impediment to that (just like in every other aspect of life still), and who knows. If COVID wasn't here, maybe I'd feel different about that. But work being really the only thing that comes into our interactions (see <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20210415_ASpectrumofGermanness.html">"You ate lunch alone"</a>) is quite a bummer for me.</p>

    <p>Again, it's not that I have a problem with anyone I work with though. The engineers and the technicians are a great group of people. and I am on good terms with all of them (afaik). Especially with all the technicians, they've always got a joke, sarcasm, or something fun on their mind, and are really fun and easy to work with. Definitely a great group of honest, supportive, helpful, hardworking people. Just no one's on a similar wavelength as me (age-, life-phase-wise), as far as I've seen.</p>

    <p>What adds to this is the two points of interaction I have with our supplier. I'm the main point of contact for the application guys from our supplier, and both the application guys are a boatload of fun every time they're on site. Younger, funny, energetic, hardworking, easy to chat with and shoot the breeze, really fun. I honestly get pumped whenever they're coming to Wörth because I know it'll be a good bit of fun. That kind of energy is missing on our team, and honestly, within the company here as a whole.</p>

    <h3 id="Location">Location</h3>

    <p>Our site/office is kinda stranded on an island. We're not near any thing other than logistics centers, a harbor, and farmland. Not bad in the grand scheme of things, but it's pretty isolated. That, paired with the fact that our site is pretty small (I'd say 200 people max, +/- 50 or so?), there's not a huge pool of people to interact with. Again, add COVID into the mix, and that pool of folks has dwindled down to a smaller group each day.</p>

    <p>Why am I bringing this up? Well, the fact that there's not a huge pool of other people to interact with. And those that are there, it's all work and nothing else.</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Cultural Commentary:</strong>  I'm not sure how much and to what extent, but there are some general cultural differences here that are playing into this. In the US, work and life are more fluidly mixed. But in Germany, looking back and seeing my experience now, work and life are very clearly separated and rarely (if ever) intertwined. I don't necessarily see anything wrong with that, as the abiltiy to leave work at work and leave it completely separate from your actual life is a huge positive. I think it's affecting me so much right now because the actual life side of things has been put on hold.>

    <h3 id="Work">The Work itself - The Root of the Problem</h3>

    <p>Despite a few complaints, the people side is not what I'd like it to be, but it's not a huge negative. Moreso me just wishing I had more than what I have. Yes Mom, that selfishness is still there. I'm working on it, I think.</p>

    <p>But the work side of things I think is playing a big part into my overall dissatisfaction. Here, I think it's a good mix of me not enjoying what I do, but also a good part of I just don't want to have to work to live and be able to do fun things.</p>

    <p>If I could just have some kind of Universal Basic Income, goddamn that'd be nice. I'd probably not work for a while just to figure out what I actually want to do and go do it. Working in the auto industry is not going to be the status quo for my whole life, and I'm looking forward to when I can do something else.</p>

    <p>But what do I want to actually do? I've always (and still do) want to get into the Renewable/Wind Energy industry, but have not truly focused to try and make that happen. I actually was offered a job with a company that would've been the PERFECT position, but I only got the offer for that after I'd already accepted the journey to come over to Germany. Bummer that that didn't work out, but other attempts have been pretty ice cold in terms of opportunity.</p>

    <p>Honestly, career-wise, I kinda feel in limbo. I've been doing what I do long enough to feel that I'm a bit pigeon-holed, even though I want to break out of it. I've got to ponder my options and desires here a bit more, but I know I've got to find something that I enjoy more on a daily basis. Not finding passion and excitement out of what you do makes it really hard to go to work on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>That's work for now, but it'll come back up after we talk about...</p>

    <h2>The Non-Work Side of Life</h2>

    <p>To be honest, the non-work side of my life feels like it hasn't really existed for the last almost year and a half. I got here a month before, and moved into my apartment a week before, the country went into the first-wave lockdown. Since that first month was pretty busy with getting into a work groove and finding an apartment, there wasn't much time to jump into things and get involved in places.</p>

    <h3 id="Frisbee">Frisbee</h3>

    <p>Frisbee is one place and one atmosphere that's been such a pivotal part of my adult life. It kinda faded out of view in Portland, but was pretty prevalent during my last time here in 2016. Thankfully, I've still got a connection to a few of the people in the community here, and am part of the Fantasy Football league, which was a blast with the guys last year.</p>

    <p>But although I've still got a connection to, and really enjoy the people of, the ultimate frisbee community in Karlsruhe, I don't have the desire to practice 2-3 times a week, spend 2-3 weekends per month on tournaments and travel, and have frisbee be the only thing that I'm able to dive into in my free time.</p>

    <p>With COVID, that wasn't going to happen anyway, but the Spring League level that I'd become accumstomed to enjoy is completely out of question. So the one method of frisbee that I'm still engaged with (drinking beer on a weekly basis with some friends and playing some frisbee in a light-hearted competitive environment) is not in the realm of possibility due to the pandemic. That's a huge bummer.</p>

    <p>It has been a slight thought of mine, maybe even a regret, that I should have jumped into this a little more headstrong because it's a group of people I already have a connection with. Though my life has morphed to other interests in the past 5 years, since I have this base connection to the group here, part of me thinks I should've reverted to a more concentrated focus on frisbee. It's not a constant thought, but it sure pops up when I start to feel alone.</p>

    <p>I don't think nor know if that would've fixed anything. It would've been hard to sacrifice the other fun areas of my life to refocus on frisbee, but would doing that have given me more interaction amidst this pandemic? More opportunities to meet new people and expand my social connections? Maybe?</p>

    <h3 id="MTB">Mountain Biking</h3>

    <p>This has easily become the biggest part of my life in the last few years. And honestly, I'm fucking loving it. Such a fun sport, such a good adrenaline rush, such a good way to stay in shape. It's a fucking blast. Unfortunately, it's not the easiest way to meet new people / it's not an activity centered around social interaction. There are two sides of this saga though.</p>

    <h4>Side 1 - Trail Building</h4>

    <p>This is the social side. Right when I got into town, I joined the local mountain biking club for a few sucessive weeks to help shape and build the new trail at the local trail network (could officially be called a network as this was Trail #2). It was great to get out and do some physical activity, but moreso the chance to meet some like-minded riders in town.</p>

    <p>Through that engagement, I not only got a feel of the trails that were in pedal-distance from home, but I got to meet a few local riders to start getting in touch with the community. One guy that I met, we really connected pretty well and he helped welcome me into town through MTB. We rode a good bit together, did some things outside of riding, and was really enjoying getting to know Franz, and through him his wife Steph and another guy in town Stefan.</p>

    <p>Well, at some point middle of last year, Franz and Steph moved to Heidelberg, as he'd landed an incredible teaching job up there. Was/am super pumped he was able to find a job he was much more excited about, but was/am bummed that the person I'd gotten to know the best had left town.</p>

    <p>There've been other occasions where I've met a few other people throguh trail building, but nothing's really panned out. I exchanged info with one guy, but he never got back to me. I live across the street from another guy who's pretty involved in the community here and seems like a like-minded rider, but we've yet to meet up.</p>

    <p>Really the only regular connections that I've made through trail building are the sons of the farmer who owns the land where the trails are located. On build days, the two kids would usually tag along, as Franz has a good connection with the farmer, and they'd help and ride along with everyone else. Well last summer I ended up getting invited to dinner with Franz and Steph and at the farmer's house (awesome guy named Marcus), and got to know little Benjamin and Sebastian. Well we exchanged phone numbers so I could let them know when I'd be riding over to the trails from town.</p>

    <p>In all honesty, they're the closest thing I've got to consistent riding buddies. Super pumped any time I'm able to meet up with Franz and ride or hang out with him, but that's a little harder/less frequent since he's up in Heidelberg. The folks that I'd met last summer in Freiburg at Lac Blanc, I'm still slated to join them in July for a trip to France, but other than sporadic chats, no real connection there. Benjamin and Sebastian are super funny and energetic, but not the riding buddies I would've expected.</p>

    <h4>Side 2 - Riding</h4>

    <p>Trail Building is a social opportunity, but Riding honestly (at least for me and my introverted mentality) is not so much. Since I'm 90% of the time just riding by myself, regardless of where, that's what I focus on and just kinda keep to myself. A couple times in Heidelberg though, I've connected with some random other riders and tagged along, but again, most of the time it's just me, my bike, and the trails.</p>

    <p>That's not a bad thing every now and then. It's refreshing and relaxing to be able to pedal when, where, and how much I want. But not having a crew of riding buddies to enjoy the highs and lows, ups and downs, jumps and rocks, along the way, is not quite as fun. Knowing I've got an incredibly awesome group of folks back home to ride with doesn't make this aspect easy.</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Cultural Commentary:</strong>  To add to all of this, the kind of riding I like (Downhill/Enduro - pedal up because you have to, ride down because you want to), seems to be a less common riding style over here. Don't get me wrong, definitely a lot of DH riders here, but at least most of the people that I've connected with or met that said we should go riding together, are more Cross-Country (XC) riders, with an equal or higher focus on the ups versus the downs. That's cool, but just not what I like to ride. I'll ride up for the fitness but down for the fun, with a HUGE focus on the down because it's way more (or really actually) fun.</p>

    <h3 id="Swing">Swing Dancing</h3>

    <p>The big hit in all of this pandemic regarding activities has been swing dancing. I haven't danced since I left Portland, and honestly, I miss it a lot. No, I'm not good, but learning how to swing dance had been a true fun spot in my life in Portland, slowly progessing and learning how to move a little more fluid and gracefully through some great music with some great people.</p>

    <p>As soon as I'd landed here, I tried to find a way to keep that going, but the first attempt I screwed up the days, the second attempt was at a 'practice night' at the dance school which didn't sit right, and then COVID hit. Swing dancing isn't exactly an activity where you can maintain social distancing, so it's taken a bit of a backseat to a lot of things.</p>

    <p>I reached out to the dance school a few months ago to see how I could get back into it. Their response was that I could sign up to try and find a dance partner, and then I kinda lost motivation. This is definitely on me, as there seem to be ways to get into it, but mentally I've just dropped the ball or forgot about it more often than not.</p>

    <h3 id="Backpacking">Backpacking / Nature</h3>

    <p>To say I am spoiled to have grown up and lived in the Pacific Northwest is a severe understatement. It's easily the <a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8IyAfLF1jw">best corner of the US</a> with everything you'd need, and the nature there is really second to none.</p>

    <p>I knew, going from Portland to Karlsruhe, that my nature surroundings would change. Europe still has some incredible mountains and nature, but whereas in Portland it's an hour away, in Karlsruhe it's a minimum of 3-4 hours away. And the nature that is near Karlsruhe is very pretty in its own right, but just clearly different compared to what I like diving into. Rather than mountains, it's big hills with forest roads criss-crossing every other inch of the place.</p>

    <p>Adding to that, what you can do in the nature is more limited too (for good reasons, but a bummer nonetheless). Here I can't just throw my tent in a backpack, find an empty set of forest, and call it a night without having some worry in the back of my head that I'll get caught. I definitely miss that capability and method of just shutting off and escaping the world. Being able to go out and do a quick weekend backpack trip would have made the past year and a half a good bit different.</p>

    <p>As I said, it's not like there isn't any nature here near me. To a good extent, it's just me being choosy, selfish, not being understanding of the differences, and kinda just throwing a temper tantrum that I don't have what I want. Childish, and stupid, for sure. The nature here in Karlsruhe area is nice, just not what I'm used to. And a little further out is what I'm used to, but it just sucks that it's farther away than I'd like.</p>

    <p>This hits two aspects. The singletrail, middle of nature, backpacking/hiking trails that you find everywhere in the PNW are harder to find here. A lot of trails are forest roads with short stretches of hiking trails. But as forests are mostly private/commercial here, it's not quite the secluded nature I know back home. Then, because the nature is largely privately owned, it's harder to build MTB trails, which leads to long delays in getting trails built, and a lack of understanding for non bikers about the interest for MTB trails.</p>

    <h3 id="Travel">Travel / Adventuring</h3>

    <p>Europe is really quite an incredible place. So many countries, cultures, languages, and mentalities, all crammed into a packed continent. All of those above are things that played into my accepting the role over here. Stemming from my CBYX years, I've loved adventuring around the world and seeing new things. The desire to travel around, visit new countries, new cultures, new languages, get insights into other facets of Europe, interact with people with different experiences in life, see the many other beautiful natural areas that Europe has to offer, was one of the big draws to me taking the plunge to come back over here. Unfortunately, with COVID, that's been nearly eliminated.</p>

    <p class="quickhit"><em>(I apologize for this next bit, as it's a rant reeking of privelege. Sorry.)</em></p>

    <p>Since arriving/landing in Germany in January 2020, one month before the whole world shut down, within <u>Europe</u>, I've been to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slovakia, on a two-week jaunt with my buddy Yann</li>
      <li>France, twice to go ride at the Lac Blanc Bike Park</li>
      <li>France, once to get pan au chocolate with Lutz</li>
    </ul>
    <p>..and then within <u>Germany</u> I've been to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Karlsruhe - obviously, I live there</li>
      <li>Freiburg and Heidelberg to ride their awesome mountain bike trails</li>
      <li>Schwäbisch Alb to camp out on the land, drink some beers, and see some beautiful landscapes</li>
      <li>Oberstdorf for the first taste of actual mountains in Europe this time around</li>
      <li>Berchtesgaden National Park for some more actual amazing mountains</li>
      <li>Regensburg to see the Valhalla Monument</li>
      <li>Stuttgart a bunch of times to visit the Hollowells and a few other friends</li>
      <li>The Schwarzwald and Pfälzischer Wald for some hiking and snowshoeing</li>
      <li>Oberfranken for a bike tour with Lutz</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope this doesn't come across as me not being thankful for being able to go to and experience all of these things. I truly am! My expectations, however, coming into this were that I would have the chance to see and do so much more, and not be limited by the damn global pandemic that brought life to its knees.</p>

    <p>But since COVID hit, I've not felt that adventuring to a new city, even within Germany, would be viable or enjoyable. First due to the driving, but that is most definitely doable. But driving to a city that is largely closed down would not be ideal. And for the cities that are farther away, (3+ hours away), not having the option to stay somewhere adds to the complicated equation. Having to decide between making a really long day trip out of it, or sleeping in the car, my mind tends toward just not going. Not sure if that's the right mentality, but I've tried to maximize my time in other ways.</p>

    <p>Then, with the rollercoaster that is the changing border regulations, for a good chunk of the time, I have not even been allowed to cross the border into France (which is 30min from my front door), without having to quarantine upon return. As each wave has come and gone, and we're still in the middle of the third wave as I'm typing this out, things have constantly changed. That has (most definitely mentally, if not also very consistently feasible), shut out the opportunity to travel to France (30min), Switzerland (2hrs), Austria (3h), Belgium (3h) and the like, despite how close they are.</p>

    <p>This has felt so limiting and restricting to me. I have more options than I give myself credit for, but the presence of what feels to be so many fences, limits, restrictions, and limitations, has given me a sense of being confined to Germany, and at that a small portion of Germany.</p>

    <p>For one, Karlsruhe is in the corner of Germany. So as you look at the map, a full 3/4 of the directions I could go, are immediately out, and then further closed down as you expand outwards. Then, as a point of comparison, my mind is sporadically filled with the comparisons of what I'd still be able to do in the US. Although the situation in the US was worse than the worst for the first year, it has slowly getting better since January 2021, and throughout that time, one has been able to travel between states, and most importantly, jump into the bounty of nature.</p>

    <p>For me, this is essentially the mental mindset that I have when I think about what could be.</p>





    <h3>Mindset</h3>

    <p>To be honest, my mindset has played a lot into everything. As you would expect. And I sure as shit know that I'm not special in regard, as COVID and this whole situation has effected everyone in the world.</p>

    <p>My lovely, dearest Mommy brought up a good point on this. Essentially, when









    <p class="quickhit"><strong>Cultural Commentary:</strong>  In the last few months, I have really lost touch with the CBYX mentality that was fostered in me during my exchange program. I've become much less patient, understanding, and in some ways openminded, about living in a foreign country.</p>


    <h3 id="Forward">The Dilemma - Stay or Go?</h3>


    <img class="horz" src="" alt=""></img><br>

    <p>NASA and space
	- Perseverance
	- Felt like I was part of it watching the landing
	- Holy shit the videos and everything that came back!!!
	- I wish I worked on something like that that I could give more of a shit about


Thoughts on the Future
	- Can I make it to the end of my contract?
	- Should I stay for longer? - dependent on if corona gets the fuck out of here or not


Where am I
	- I am stressed because of a need to achieve something
	- I feel like I need to achieve or do something, in order to feel less stress
	- I feel like am am Orientierungslos, like I don’t have a clear direction in life
	- I should focus on the source of this stress. Achieving and doing things helps, but why is that stress there?
	- No woman - stress
	- No desired job - stress
	- Why is that stress there (basis question)?
	- Thought experiment - what if Scotland works out? …..
Unverfügbarkeit - Im consistently making sure that I don’t close any doors or eliminate any possibilities, although the stress of having to choose between so many options could be a contributing factor

Love Life

It sucks/doesn't exist right now. Working so much, and not doing things that put me in situations to meet new people enough. Kinda shooting myself in the foot right there.


Self-Realization

Seeing that I can be a bit of an arrogant prick in some situations. First Summer League frisbee game, a little louder than I give myself credit for, the fun I poke could definitely be taken as arrogance.



Talking with my mom about the struggles I'm having with being here. She brought up how I'd prepared myself for a downgrade in a few aspects of my life before I came over. But, with COVID, although I was prepared for an anticipated level of downgrade, that downgrade was drastically accentuated and increased, which is contributing to my dissatisfaction and frustration.



Self-Reflection

Put it on my summer to-do list (oh yeah, I made myself a summer to-do list) to go back through and read my old blog posts. Been pretty fun and reminiscient so far.
