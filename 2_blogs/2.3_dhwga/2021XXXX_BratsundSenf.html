    <p>Get it? It's like saying "Life ain't all about roses and sunshine" but I germanified it.</p>

    <p>Impeccably articulate prose aside, the saying holds. Life ain't all sunshine and roses. And that definitely holds true in my life.</p>

    <p>To be honest, I've started to really struggle with being in Germany over the last couple of months. There's a lot that plays into this, and I'm going to take this opportunity for me to do a bit of a brain dump and lay out my thoughts to help me process my mindset and experience thus far. It'll probably be pretty personal, and we'll see how much I'm willing to lay it all bare, but I hope this gives a bit more of an insight into my life, in general and specific to being over here.</p>

    <h3>DISCLAIMERS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This is not necessarily going to be a cohensive stream of thoughts, but moresoe a chaotic flow of rambling</li>
      <li>There's gonna be some ups with the downs, and likely just a big collection of thoughts and musings I've been wanting to touch on for a while</li>
      <li>Unlike most of my other posts, this is gonna be a lot of words and not a lot of pictures. Not my style, but everyone's gotta brain-dump at some point</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With that, here goes...</p>

    <h2 id="Work">Work Struggles</h2>

    <p>Let's get work out of the way first. Overall, work is going ok over here. I've got a good manager, working with a bunch of really experienced and competent people (and a few that aren't either), and the project is moving along ok.</p>

    <p>Considering the fact that work is really the only thing able to go on in life right now, it's also kind of a bummer that I'm not really enjoying what I'm doing. I think that can be boiled to a number of reasons, and it's a bit scattered and compounding.</p>

    <h3>Colleagues</h3>

    <p>Something I learned in my last job is that it's not about what you do day to day, but who you work with. The people you work with and interact with make such a huge difference and have such a massive impact on the ability to enjoy what you do.</p>

    <p>The folks on my team are extremely competent, experienced, and really good at what they do. Additionally, I'd be more than happy to grab a beer with them all, aka I get along with all of them pretty well. Ability to interact and cooperate and work together and tolerate each other is definitely not the problem.</p>

    <p>The downside is that a) the culture here isn't like what I'm used to in the US where you do something outside of work together every now and then or try to foster some kind of non-work interactions if the interest is there, and more prevalent is b) that all of my coworkers are in a different life stage than me.</p>

    <p>The reason I think this is so prominent for me is the fact that I don't have the ability to do much of anything outside of work. Since my main inter-personal interactions are all work-related, it's a bummer that I don't have the chance to connect with my colleagues on a more enjoyable, not-work-related level. Granted, COVID obviously has been and continues to be a big impediment to that (just like in every other aspect of life still), and who knows. If COVID wasn't here, maybe I'd feel different about that. But work being really the only thing that comes into our interactions (see <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2.3_dhwga/20210415_ASpectrumofGermanness.html">"You ate lunch alone"</a>) is quite a bummer for me.</p>

    <p>Again, it's not that I have a problem with anyone I work with though. The engineers and the technicians are a great group of people. and I am on good terms with all of them (afaik). Definitely a great group of honest, supportive, helpful, hardworking people. Just no one's on a similar wavelength as me (age-, life-phase-wise), as far as I've seen.</p>

    <p>What adds to this is the two points of interaction I have with our supplier. I'm the main point of contact for the application guys from our supplier, and both the application guys are a boatload of fun every time they're on site. Younger, funny, energetic, hardworking, easy to chat with and shoot the breeze, really fun. I honestly get pumped whenever they're coming to WÃ¶rth because I know it'll be a good bit of fun. That kind of energy is missing on our team.</p>

    <h3>Location</h3>

    <p>Our site/office is kinda stranded on an island. We're not near any thing other than logistics centers, a harbor, and farmland. Not bad in the grand scheme of things, but it's pretty isolated. That, paired with the fact that our site is pretty small (I'd say 200 people max, +/- 50 or so?), there's not a huge pool of people to interact with. Again, add COVID into the mix, and that pool of folks has dwindled down to a smaller group each day.</p>

    <p>Why am I bringing this up? Well, the fact that there's not a huge pool of other people to interact with.</p>

    <h3>The Work itself - The Root of the Problem</h3>

    <p>Despite a few complaints, the people side is not what I'd like it to be, but it's not a huge negative. Me just wishing I had more than what I had. Yes Mom, that selfishness is still there. I'm working on it, I think.</p>

    <p>But the work side of things I think is playing a big part into my overall dissatisfaction. Here, I think it's a good mix of me not enjoying what I do, but also a good part of I just don't want to have to work to live and be able to do fun things.</p>

    <p>If I could just have some kind of Universal Basic Income, goddamn that'd be nice. I'd probably not work for a while just to figure out what I actually want to do and go do it. Working in the auto industry is not going to be the status quo for my whole life, and I'm looking forward to when I can do something else.</p>

    <p>But what do I want to actually do? I've always (and still do) want to get into the Renewable/Wind Energy industry, but have not truly focused to try and make that happen. I actually was offered a job with a company that would've been the PERFECT position, but I only got the offer for that after I'd already accepted the journey to come over to Germany. Bummer that that didn't work out, but other attempts have been pretty ice cold in terms of opportunity.</p>

    <p>Honestly, career-wise, I kinda feel in limbo. I've been doing what I do long enough to feel that I'm a bit pigeon-holed, even though I want to break out of it. I've got to ponder my options and desires here a bit more, but I know I've got to find something that I enjoy more on a daily basis. Not finding passion and excitement out of what you do makes it really hard to go to work on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>That's work for now, but it'll come back up after we talk about...</p>

    <h2 id="Nonwork">The Non-Work Side of Life</h2>

    <p>To be honest, the non-work side of my life feels like it hasn't really existed for the last almost year and a half. I got here a month before, and moved into my apartment a week before, the country went into the first-wave lockdown. Since that first month was pretty busy with getting into a work groove and finding an apartment, there wasn't much time to jump into things and get involved in places.</p>

    <h3>Frisbee</h3>

    <p>Frisbee is one place and one atmosphere that's been such a pivotal part of my adult life. It kinda faded out of view in Portland, but was pretty prevalent during my last time here in 2016. Thankfully, I've still got a good connection to a few of the people in the community here, and am part of the Fantasy Football league, which was a blast with the guys last year.</p>

    <p>But although I've still got a good connection to, and really enjoy the people of, the ultimate frisbee community in Karlsruhe, I don't have the desire to practice 2-3 times a week, spend 2-3 weekends per month on tournaments and travel, and have frisbee be the only thing that I'm able to dive into in my free time.</p>

    <p>With COVID, that wasn't going to happen anyway, but the Spring League level is completely out of question. So the one method of frisbee that I'm still engaged with (drinking beer on a weekly basis with some friends and playing some frisbee in a light-hearted competitive environment) is not in the realm of possibility due to the pandemic. That's a huge bummer.</p>

    <p>It has been a slight thought of mine, maybe even a regret, that I should have jumped into this a little more headstrong because it's a group of people I already have a connection. Though my life has morphed to other interests in the past 5 years, since I have this base connection to the group here, part of me thinks I should've reverted to a more concentrated focus on frisbee. It's not a constant thought, but it sure pops up when I start to feel alone.</p>

    <p>I don't think nor know if that would've fixed anything. It would've been hard to sacrifice the other fun areas of my life to refocus on frisbee, but would doing that have given me more interaction amidst this pandemic? More opportunities to meet new people and expand my social connections? Maybe?</p>

    <h3>Mountain Biking</h3>

    <p>This has easily become the biggest part of my life in the last few years. And honestly, I'm fucking loving it. Such a fun sport, such a good adrenaline rush, such a good way to stay in shape. It's a fucking blast. Unfortunately, it's not the easiest way to meet new people / it's not an activity centered around social interaction. There are two sides of this saga though.</p>

    <h4>Side 1 - Trail Building</h4>

    <p>This is the social side. Right when I got into town, I joined the local mountain biking club for a few sucessive weeks to help shape and build the new trail at the local trail network (could officially be called a network as this was Trail #2). It was great to get out and do some physical activity, but moreso the chance to meet some like-minded riders in town.</p>





    <p>Meet a few. Franz moved to Heidelberg. Exchanged info with one guy, never responded. Live across the street from another guy, but we've yet to meet up.</p>




    <h3 id="Forward">The Dilemma - Stay or Go?</h3>


    <img class="horz" src="" alt=""></img><br>

    <p>NASA and space
	- Perseverance
	- Felt like I was part of it watching the landing
	- Holy shit the videos and everything that came back!!!
	- I wish I worked on something like that that I could give more of a shit about

Struggles

	- Non-work - really starting to get to me not being able to go anywhere and explore

Thoughts on the Future
	- Can I make it to the end of my contract?
	- Should I stay for longer? - dependent on if corona gets the fuck out of here or not

Fun outside of Work
	- Kinda a good example - biking, best riding buddies are the kids of the farmer who lives next to the trails in Karlsruhe. Fun and funny, but not like what I have back homeâ¦

Where am I
	- I am stressed because of a need to achieve something
	- I feel like I need to achieve or do something, in order to feel less stress
	- I feel like am am Orientierungslos, like I donât have a clear direction in life
	- I should focus on the source of this stress. Achieving and doing things helps, but why is that stress there?
	- No woman - stress
	- No desired job - stress
	- Why is that stress there (basis question)?
	- Thought experiment - what if Scotland works out? â¦..
UnverfÃ¼gbarkeit - Im consistently making sure that I donât close any doors or eliminate any possibilities, although the stress of having to choose between so many options could be a contributing factor

Love Life

It sucks/doesn't exist right now. Working so much, and not doing things that put me in situations to meet new people enough. Kinda shooting myself in the foot right there.


Self-Realization

Seeing that I can be a bit of an arrogant prick in some situations. First Summer League frisbee game, a little louder than I give myself credit for, the fun I poke could definitely be taken as arrogance.




Self-Reflection

Put it on my summer to-do list (oh yeah, I made myself a summer to-do list) to go back through and read my old blog posts. Been pretty fun and reminiscient so far.
