    <p>The holiday break with Zack cruising through Portugal as an absolute blast. Back to traveling, back on another adventure with my buddy, it was a total blast. The couple days I had at home after that before work started back up was also relaxing, fun, and nice to slowly gear back up. Unfortunately, since then, it's been a whirlwind of work and chaos. I thought things would've slowed down to start the year off, but that's been way too far from the truth.</p>

    <h2 id="Snow">Snowshowing in the Schwarzwald</h2>

    <p>Before heading back to work for the year, in the couple free days I had at home after the trip, I lined up to go snowshoeing with the gal from the date before the trip. Thankfully, there was a little snow up in the hills (there hasn't been much all this year unfortunately :-( ...), so we packed our things in the car, took the short drive down to a random spot in the Schwarzwald, and got to trekking!</p>

    <p>As this was a bit of a random planning spurt, there wasn't a ton of weight placed on the perfect route or anything like that. But as it turns out, this was the same spot/area that I went for a romp around some snow last year! The conditions were about the same, there was plenty of snow on the ground, and we ended up back-tracking a good bit of the route that I took the year before.</p>

    <p>We first started on a pretty empty trail, and it was quite beautiful. Fresh snow, no people, and just a beautiful walk in the white wonderland. We eventually made it to the tiny little ski hill tucked up in the forest, and romped our way up to the top for a break with a little camp stove action and coffee.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xaHXnyOh.jpg" alt="Sweet Snowshoe"></img>

    <p>After the break, it was time for some deep trudging. The route we wanted to take was closed off for nature protection, so we blazed our own path through the deep snow and fallen trees. It was adventurous. But after a while of trudging, we were back on the path, and slowly from there worked our way downhill and back out. A great way to enjoy some fresh air before returning to the stifling world of work.</p>

    <h2 id="Food">Adventures in Foodiness</h2>

    <p>Coming into this year, I've been working on getting more proactive when it comes to food. I'm a decent cook, and I enjoy the process as well as the result, but cooking for one can become a chore. Because of that, 90% of the time I chop up some veggies, add in some meat, pick out a sauce, and put it all together either with rice, noodles, potatoes, or lettuce. Basic as shit, but it usually comes out pretty good.</p>

    <h3>Killer Cookies</h3>

    <p>Basic, deadly, and oh so delicious. Found an old cooke recipe in our family's recipe stash, and threw a couple twists in. I made some similar ones last year, and kept that delicious train rolling. Chocolate chunks, dark chocolate M&Ms, chocolate mint granola chunks, and extra leftover from christmas - christmas sprinkles. Needless to say, they turned out great.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/sIPfatuh.jpg" alt="Cookie Madness"></img>

    <p>The reason I made them though was to share with my coworkers. I initially planned to make them as christmas cookies, but by the time I got to them in December all my coworkers were already out. So I made them to start the new year. Well, results were a bit mixed. I slightly overbaked them, so they were a little dry. And to be honest, I think the presence of variety in them might have annoyed their taste buds. Either way, I found them to be delicious, and that's what mattered to me.</p>

    <h3>Crispy Chorizo Gnocchi</h3>

    <p>Slightly cheated on this one, but with the pre-packaged gnocchi, some chorizo, and a few other things to it, holy shit deeeeeelicious. The inspiration for a lot of these came from reddit, and here's <a class="body" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/nbeuno/crispy_chorizo_gnocchi/">the recipe</a> for this one, definitely helps that it's in video form (which adds to the attraction for me).</p>

    <p>I gotta say, damn fine. Some of the comments laid into the recipe for a few too many tastes, but I was fat and sassy with it as is. That little caper/parsley sauce on it though? Hot dayum that was good! The best part was that the leftovers didn't taste like leftovers, but almost got better over time. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend this flavor bomb.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/omty95eh.jpg" alt="Crispy Chorizo Gnocci"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uS32YvAh.jpg" alt="Plated and Delicious"></img>

    <h3>Brussel Sprouts</h3>

    <p>Another dusted off recipe from a Family Christmas years back, it was time for some bacon and brussel sprouts, and also the incredible balsamic glaze that goes with it. Nothing too crazy, but I've never been good at sauces or have much experience with them. This glaze is easy, and absolutely delicious.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/afNLQzIh.jpg" alt="Brussel Sprouts"></img>

    <p>Here's <a class="body" href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a49497/bacon-balsamic-brussels-sprouts-recipe/">this recipe</a>, and again, I highly recommend it!</p>

    <h3>Spinach and Artichoke Mac & Cheese</h3>

    <p>I'd never made homemade Mac & Cheese before in my life. The blue boxes from Kraft aren't the healthiest, but I find them absolutely delicious, and therefore never branched out. Well, Europe lacks those blue boxes, and it was time to venture into this cheesy world. The perfect occasion came too, having Mischa and Christoph over for dinner!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ecj1NRBh.jpg" alt="Homemade Mac"></img>

    <p>Turned out to be delicious. Kinda mixed and matched from a few recipes, but <a class="body" href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a26593313/spinach-artichoke-mac-and-cheese-recipe/">here's the base one</a> I went off of. Shittons of cheese, not quite the stringiness one expects from mac and cheese, but it was yummy.</p>

    <h3>Bruschetta Refresha</h3>

    <p>Not sure why, but one weekend I had a hankering for some mozzarella. Leftover from the gnocchi I had a little basil plant sitting in my window, and new I just needed some tomatoes and I was ready to go. So after cutting it all up, maybe winging it more than an Italian would, I had some honestly pretty damn good bruschetta up and running.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/GRmbgc6h.jpg" alt="Bruschetta"></img>

    <p>Also was on a wine kick, so that always helps :-)</p>

    <h3>Kitchen Sink Frittata</h3>

    <p>Before heading out for a spontaneous week away, I had a bunch of stuff left in the fridge and was hungry. With a ton of extra eggs being part of that group, my mind turned to a frittata! Turns out these are pretty easy to do, but mine turned out kinda ok.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XBy3dvLh.jpg" alt="First Try Frittata"></img>

    <p>In following the recipe, I got all the ingredients cooked up and ready, and then just poured over the eggs before baking. Next time I'm gonna make sure I mix the eggs and ingredients together so it's not just a layer of egg on the top. Still turned out ok, but something to make it better next time.</p>

    <h2 id="GirlProblems">Girl Problems</h2>

    <p>I don't think it's a secret, but I'm pretty single. It's a bit of a sensitive and personal topic for me, but that's where it is. As I said earlier, I went on a couple dates with a gal, and they started off pretty fine. Long story short, after sharing that I eventually want a long-term thing with a family and all that, that apparently was too much for her to handle.</p>

    <p>I had some late night chats with a number of friends to try and help me get my mind around the situation (first the excitement of connecting with someone interesting and compatible, then the frustration/confusion as to why it went south so quickly), and there are a couple things that have come out of that experience. For one, I know what I want, and it's not necessarily a bad thing to share that. Timing, however, is important. I likely was too excited and jumped the gun on a few discussions, but I'm an excitable (and impatient) person. Both need to be tempered to a good degree in certain situations.</p>

    <p>Next, I may know what I want, which is really good for me and all. But other people are on different paths. Unfortunately, with this gal, she doesn't know where she's going. To be honest, glad that red flag came up quick. Nonetheless, bummer to know yet again I'm back at Square 0.</p>

    <p>Short and cryptic, but all that to say, nothing's working out on this front, and I'm trying to come to grips with that. And in the mean time, focus on me, work on who I am, and get my head on straight so I can be sure to love myself before trying to love someone else.</p>

    <h2 id="BikeHD">Back on the Bike - Heidelberg</h2>

    <p>I can never go too long without a little two-wheeled fury, so it was high time for me to be back on my steed and heading downhill. It's still winter over here, but thankfully that doesn't mean that all the trails are closed down, so I headed up to Heidelberg for a day in the woods.</p>

    <p>It was a cold, chilly, misty-sunny day there, and damn it was a lot of fun. The ground was pretty much frozen, and grip was fantastic. Somehow I re-discovered both a really technical trail (yes!!!) and a trail with a couple drops (yes!!!), and it was an absolutely fantastic ride!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cIxzcLnh.jpg" alt="Sunny Snowy Morning"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/H4rVZWth.jpg" alt="Bike Ready"></img>

    <p>In the interest of being social and not being a total hermit, I reached out to my buddy Franz, who moved up to Heidelberg last year. He wasn't able to join on the ride, but after I was done I motored on over to their place and got to meet up with them! After talking with him and his wife Steph (and their new baby Anton!), it'd been over a year and a half since we'd last seen each other. Bummer of a realization, but thankfully it was just like yesterday in seeing them again. Great folks, great friends, and I'm super glad I got to see them after the ride.</p>

    <p>Well that rekindling of contact led to further rekindling and riding, as I got back in contact with Stefan here in Karlsruhe, who's also great friends with Franz! A few weeks later, we were able to meet up, all four of us (Franz's parents were in town and were able to watch over Anton), and head out on a ride! It was another cold day, and this time a little slipperier and wetter than before, but another great ride together.</p>

    <p>Having riding buddies is such a nice bonus. I'd be riding either way, but it's so much fun to have folks to shred, laugh, and ride with! Adding to that sentiment, more to come later :-)</p>

    <h2 id="Bierkistendecken">Bierkistendecken - Project Complete</h2>

    <p>Going all the way back to last summer, I had a conversation with Christoph about a little project he wanted to do. Beer cases here are all a standard size - hard plastic, 20 bottles at 0.5L, and stackable. Well he somehow got the idea to make a topper for them, so you can use the cases as tables/chairs/nightstands/whatever.</p>

    <p>That conversation was all the way back in Summer 2021. And with my slow-ass progress, it took me all the way until Winter 2022 to get them done! But after coming back from Portugal, finally getting over the mental hump and hindrance of staining, I made some progress. After a total of three coats on each one, they were done!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZZYsLNqh.jpg" alt="Singular Topper"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/kColOmnh.jpg" alt="Toppers in a Row - Front"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CTpdmzyh.jpg" alt="Toppers in a Row - Side"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/O3AS8Xhh.jpg" alt="Toppers in Use"></img>

    <p>In total, I made seven of them. One broke while building, so the six that came out in the end turned out pretty good. Some were made with some scrap wood, some from a new board I cut down to size. Two were for Christoph (since it was his idea), two were for me, one for Mischa, and one for a gift that I had to put together (more to come later).</p>

    <p>I love me a good woodworking project. Unfortunately, I'm really slow at them, and the processes of sanding and staining are such annoying mental hurdles for me. But nevertheless, nothing like having a beautiful tangible product at the end!</p>

    <h2 id="Organization">Getting Organized</h2>

    <p>One thing that really wore me out last year was just having so much to do, so much I wanted to get done, and not nearly a semblance of enough time to get it all done. It caused a lot of stress, frustration, and was just mentally draining to have all the things I wanted to get done in my mind (and a lot that I forgot about to boot...), and just not being able to fit them in. All because I was either working too much, focusing on something big, or just lacked the energy or motivation to get started on something even when I had the time to do so.</p>

    <p>Back when I was part of the autonomous project, we tried to implement a bunch of agile methodologies into our work, and one that I really liked was our <a class="body" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards">kanban board</a>. I had my own color, all my tasks were clearly laid out on the board, and I was able to physically move them around depending on what I was working on and what I'd completed.</p>

    <p>Around that time back in Portland, I even went so far as to implement that at home. I had that weird, unusable fireplace thing right in the middle of the living room, and that empty space turned into my kanban board. I had a few different categories of tasks I had in front of me, tracked the priority, and had a done pile for whenever I completed something.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="" alt="My kanban board"></img>

    <p>Well right now, I'm not going in depth on anything or categorizing anything at all, I'm just working on the first step of getting the things I have to do laid out in front of me so I can track them. It's a single color, a jumbled mess of things to do, but I'm just working on making sure I keep track of all the things I have to do, and give myself the minimal reward of moving the post-it to the done pile once it's complete. It's also on my coat jacket closet, so every time I leave the house or come back, it's right in my face.</p>

    <p>Progress. Small progress, but progress nonetheless!</p>

    <h2 id="Photography">Photography Stuff</h2>

    <p>Coming out of the trip to Portugal, and having looked back at all the pictures I took, I was a bit disappointed in the overall quality of them. Yes, there were some good ones, but a lot of pictures that I was really excited about, liked, or were hoping for good results, came out blurry or just not ideal. Being a visual person, that really bummed me out.</p>

    <p>That said, my camera is 9 years old. The last time I took it in for service, the technician guy said at that point a few years ago, that it was an old bird anyways. So, knowing the camera body was likely on its last legs anyways, I splurged and got myself a new camera! My old Canon Rebel T4i is still alive (for now), but now I'm rolling around with a Canon 90D. There's a lot different about it compared to the old T4i, but those'll all just take some time to get used to.</p>

    <p>As soon as I got it, I sat around and played with the controls and settings to try and familiarize myself with it. My living room was my first test subject, and I got in a couple shots just to see how I can dial myself in with the thing.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/aRsEiKgh.jpg" alt="My Feet"></img><br>

    <h3>Night Photography</h3>

    <p>As a first little excursion with the new rig, I decided to take a cold, random Friday, jump on my bike, and head out with my tripod to get in some night photography practice. As I said, it was cold, and at the first stop I realized I forgot the tripod-camera mount (stupid), but I got to work on trying to capture some night scenes.</p>

    <p>It'd been a REALLY long while since I'd used my tripod or tried to do anything like this, and it turns out it's not as easy as I laid it all out in my head. I somehow would always come out with blurry pictures, and I think there were a couple culprits to that. For one, my tripod is light, but can be a tad unstable. Then again, any movement, wind or otherwise, is enough to make a blurry picture when the exposure goes for over half a second.</p>

    <p>Another likely reason, is that I was choosing some difficult scenes. In order to use autofocus, you need high contrast for the focus points to be able to get the right detail on the focus. For a couple of spots I wanted to shoot, there was very little contrast - aka everything was a similar shade of dark - and therefore autofocus had a tough time finding a spot to focus onto.</p>

    <p>All that said, I've still got a lot of room for improvement. Despite the cold night, I had some tunes in my ears and did a little riding around town to a few different spots, and came up with a few ok shots. Take a look!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/SsSbzjEh.jpg" alt="KVV Haltestelle"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/yCwFLWhh.jpg" alt="The Lonely Trike"></img>

    <p>Not quite as good as my night shots from way back when in Hamburg, but something to keep cranking away at for sure. Looking forward to some warmer weather to make it a little easier to wander around at night!</p>

    <h3>Working on the Craft</h3>

    <p>Not sure how, but I've kinda gotten onto a mini reading kick, which I hope is slowly turning into a habit, since the start of the year. It's waned a bit in recent weeks, but after finishing off the book from José Saramago, I went to my bookshelf to see what I could dive into next. Rather than going the fiction route, I saw a couple photography books that I'd gotten but never read, and popped them out.</p>

    <p>First up is <em>Photography for the Joy of It</em>, and has been a great baseline look into the art of photography. Some concepts are new, some not, but getting a clarification on a lot of things, as well as some depth to the details behind them, has been a nice course.</p>

    <p>I've tried to internalize what I can from the book, and plan on using them next time I'm out traveling or shooting more photos. Here's to some improvement!</p>

    <h2 id="Swing">Getting Back to Swing</h2>

    <p>This whole pandemic bullshit has really had a negative impact on all of our lives, and one aspect for me that has been grinding me has been swing dancing. I haven't danced since I left Portland, which is now over two years ago. That's a crazy long time to not do something that I found so much enjoyment and fun in.</p>

    <p>To try and remedy this (and it's on my kanban board so I can't forget about it), I reached out to the local dance school to see what my options were. Long story short, I need a dance partner before I can dance. Not an easy prospect being still a foreigner and quasi-newbie in this town, but that's the deal.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, the dance school has a little portal to try and connect people looking for dance partners, so on the hunt! Luckily enough, I got in contact with one gal who seemed to be at a similar level. Needless to say, I was pretty excited. After a little back and forth and some contact, I confirmed it on my end that we'd start the coming Sunday, and assumed we were all good to go.</p>

    <p>Well, showing up to the dance school on that Sunday, I got my shoes on, and waited, but no one came. Since a parter is required to dance, I was left high and dry. I waited around a little while, but she never showed. Quite the bummer if you ask me.</p>

    <p>So, despite the impression that I was good to go and dance-ready, starting back (yet again) at Square 0. A common theme in a few aspects of life, but the search continues!</p>

    <h2 id="Sinsheim">The Technik Museum - Sinsheim</h2>

    <p>In the bridge between January and February, we were lucky enough to be able to host one of our testing colleagues from Portland during the integration workshop! Well, as I'd taken a trip out to the Technik Museum in Speyer in September, I didn't want Jon (our colleague) sitting around all weekend, so we planned to head up to the Technik Museum in Sinsheim! It was a short drive up, but we motored over and got to exploring the twin to the one in Speyer.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/FhguqFqh.jpg" alt="Concorde and Russian Copy"></img>

    <p>As you'd imagine, it was just as cool and just as crammed with all kinds of stuff to please our engineering eyes and minds. Quite the conglomeration of cars, planes, trains, boats, tanks, and you can guess the rest. We did a lot of walking around, admiring the many unique and incredible pieces of machinery on site.</p>

    <p>Here were some of the highlights and thoughts we had during our romp around the museum:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I have no idea where they collected all these pieces, but there's a shitton of stuff there</li>
      <li>They have one of Lamborghini's old tractors!</li>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cCnXOCVh.jpg" alt="Lamborghini Tractor"></img>
      <li>They had a ton of tanks on site, but all of them were De-Militarized. What does that mean? Essentially a giant chuck of the armor had to be cut out to designate it as a no-longer functional tank. Pretty cool method.</li>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/jgvxu3eh.jpg" alt="Tank Row"></img><br>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q0CBb7oh.jpg" alt="Demilitarisierung"></img>
      <li>Jesus Fucking Christ. Who the hell thought it ok to allow fucking swastikas in the museum. There weren't many, but goddamnit..... Get that sign of hatred out of there...</li>
      <li>Communism stands for Copying. I had no idea, but the USSR had created essentially a copy of the Concorde, and the museum had one on display. Cool plane, but seriously, nearly carbon copy...</li>
      <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iJ44Tqah.jpg" alt="Concorde and Copy-SSR"></img>
    </ul>

Great day on Tuesay, February 15th.


Germany has cultural foods because of guest workers. Italian and turkish - yufka likely invented in Stuttgart from guest workers


Italy
- really laid back when it comes to time
- speaking with the hands is a real thing
- oh my god the food. The smaller the restaurant, the better. Five tables max is a sign of a really good spot
