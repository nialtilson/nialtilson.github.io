    <p>As the saying goes, it's better late than never, and this is extremely relevant to everything in here. After having COVID middle of last summer, I've been lacking on a lot of updates and goings-on that's filled my life since then. So in the interest of getting my ass and this here blog back up to date, here's a quick shimmy through the last year of activity.</p>

    <h2 id="Love">My Love Life</h2>

    <p>As hesitant as I am to talk about my love life and relationships and all that jazz, I think it's no secret to anyone that that aspect of my life is not only very important to me, but also very inactive. Not ideal. But in the middle of last summer I ended up matching with someone on Bumble, and after some pretty good initial conversation, we met up for the first time in Pforzheim for a bike ride and walk around town.</p>

    <p>The bike ride took us along the river, up onto a plateau and to an awesome bench to watch the clouds, back down to another river, then back into town. There ended up being a music fest that evening downtown so we got some food, and then headed into the music fest for a bit to enjoy the scene. One band there turned out to be pretty catchy (<a class="body" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B01On7YZSqA">Vagabund by Kicker Dibs</a>), and overall the date went really well. So well that we lost track of time, and eventually I looked at train times and was in a real tight spot. I had to say a quick goodbye, sprint with my bike to the train station, ride down the stairs and through the tunnels and barely made it to the last train back to Karlsruhe for the night.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/RccuMIjh.jpg" alt="Bike Ride Blue Skies"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/7CjHpgMh.jpg" alt="Kicker Dibs"></img>

    <p>Thankfully, despite the prompt goodbye, things went well and we really hit it off. Through July we were able to meet up a good few times, including a few trips to the lake after work, a short weekend backpacking trip in the Schwarzwald coupled with a visit to the local fire station's fest, and a bunch of random dates here and there. Things progressed quick but super naturally, and needless to say, I was ecstatic to finally have something in my love life slowly come together with such a cool, mature, adventurous, intelligent woman.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning, we maintained really open, honest, and clear communication. That included being frank about what the future holds for both of us. She was in the process of becoming a teacher, and as I learned from her about the German teaching system, that included its own long list of restrictions and complications and the like. I am/was unsure of where my life was truly headed. But on a lot of big topics we matched pretty darn well and that helped draw us pretty close together.</p>

    <p>Summer for her started once she was done with her Referendariat (teacher training) duties for the year, and with that she was off to continue her trek along the <a class="body" href="http://www.via-alpina.org/en/page/237/the-red-trail">Via Alpina</a>. One August weekend I was itching to GTFO of work, and set up with her to jump down and do some of the trail with her over a few days. But I was able to do part of it as a surprise, as I left early, got down there at night to sleep in the car near Klosters Dorf, and then hike up and over a saddle to surprise her early in the small town of Gargellen.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/q494lgch.jpg" alt="She's Comin down the Mountain"></img>

    <p>In that quick stint of the trek I was able to join, we got in four days of hiking together, and in the middle of all of it, made our relationship official. It's cheezy, but I'm kinda proud about how that happened.</p>
    
    <p>In German, "friend" and "girlfriend" are the same word - Freundin. The way you tell them apart is by the presence, or lack thereof, of a possessive pronoun. "A friend/eine Freundin" is friend, whereas "my friend/<strong>m</strong>eine Freundin" is girlfriend. So, to see if we were a thing I asked her "So how do I tell people about you - a friend, or my friend?" Cheeky, but it worked, and with that Theresa and I had something going.</p>

    <p><em>Gonna jump ahead a good bit here to keep these topics here all bundled together.</em></p>

    <p>With that, we slowly integrated our lives together as best we could. We both had a busy summer with full travel plans for both of us. In the midst of all the travel, we did our best to spend time together and have some fun. Some highlights there include goign with my Mommy to a Weinfest in the Pfalz...</p>

    <p>Christmas Market time in Heidelberg and in Karlsruhe, and then followed that up with a week down in Austria doing some snowboarding and snowshoeing.</p>

    <p>...and a good number of other hikes, adventures, and other stuff around the area. Tons of great conversations, laughs, deep talks, and close times. But due to the nature of both of our situations, slowly we had to keep approaching some deep topics that touched on some long term implications.</p>

    <p>As I mentioned, Theresa was a going through teacher certification. In Germany, it's a pretty rigorous process to become a teacher, which culminates in essentially a 2-year student teaching program, and once you successfully complete that you apply for jobs within the Bundesland (state/county) you want to teach in, and then begin your career. Theresa was toying with her prospects and was unsure where things were going to take her.</p>

    <p>Pair that with my situation of not knowing where my life is veering off towards, that made for some tough conversations. Despite the strong bond that'd grown between us, it was a shit-or-get-off-the-pot kinda situation that we'd arrived at, and things got difficult. What it boiled down to was that if we were going to stay together, it would essentially mean that I'd have to be willing to live in Germany my whole life. She was not open to moving abroad, let alone outside of a 3-hr radius from her hometown. No one can fault her for that, she's a family person and that's something I admire. But that put me in quite the pickle I had to really try and work through.</p>
    
    <p>As someone who struggles with big decisions, how the fuck do I work out a decision like that? Initially started out with what do I want to do with my life, and now would I be willing to never move back to my home country? Not an easy situation. I did my best to hash it out on my own and with the many friends I've got, but I had to see a therapist to work through my ideas. One of the results out of that was a big Pros/Cons list I had to produce regarding living in both the US and in Germany to help try and tackle some of the many questions occupying my head.</p>

    <p>Well, in the interest of brevity and the fact that the true deliberations are better discussed over a beer, eventually it came down to me answering that question - could I see myself living in Germany for always? - with a no. And in turn, that put the end spell of our relationship.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, fuck... Finally, someone who's into me and I'm into them, a relationship that matches well, we're happy, we fit well together, and then life moves in a direction opposite of us which leads to a breakup. Granted, there were some aspects from my point of view that were still outstanding for me to think about, but overall, life came at us quickly and pushed things to a T. Since I wasn't able to say I'd be willing to live in Germany forever, we called it a day.</p>

    <p>It has been a tough adjustment flying solo again. Pair that with the heavy unsureness I've been lugging around regarding my future, and it's been touch and go every now and then. Overall, I'm getting through it fairly well, but being single again is a bummer.</p>

    <p>I miss Theresa, she's an awesome woman. But now it's back to just me and we'll see what life brings next. It's no lie that having a strong relationship in my life is something very important that I want to have in my life. I had that with her and now it's gone, now I'm back at square one. We'll see what happens next...</p>

    <h2 id="Biking">The Wheels on my Bikes go Round and Round</h2>

    <p>Through thick and thin, good times and bad, my bikes are things that always keep me moving and sane. Fresh air, nature, adrenaline, or just getting from A to B. Bikes are life.</p>

    <p>In the last year I've been doing well at staying constantly in motion with both my new Madonna and trusty Honzo. Some trips around the Rhein area in summer with the great weather and great bike paths, and a good number of times out in the dirt with my MTB buddies over here shredding whenever and wherever we could.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/JPQbyBxh.jpg" alt="Lac Blanc Morning Prep"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/mQKCtJCh.jpg" alt="Waiting for the Ferry"></img>

    <p>In the middle of summer, to the pure delight of all in the area, I was even graced with a visit by the honorable, estemmable, and unmatchable Friar Gnarthaller himself!!! Collette was over for a business trip, and Colin was able to pop along for the ride. One fine work day I took off early and we headed up to Heidelberg to do some shredding. What a fucking blast! His mustache and riding game was strong (as always), and Matze was even able to join along for the ride. What a treat!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/CJHa0O7h.jpg" alt="The Ride Crew"></img>

    <p>Due to some night testing for my automated high-beam feature, for some reason in the middle of July, I had a couple free mornings before I had to go into work late. To utilize one of them, I took my Madonna on down to Sasbachwalden and did a big pedal all the way up to the top of the Hornisgrinde. A great view on a great day made the pedal up worth it. But the Rumpelstiltzken trail wasn't all that great there from the top top on down. Thankfully the rest of the trails were, and that was one kick-ass way to start a work day.</p>

    <p>A lot of the riding has taken place up in Heidelberg with the walking Wikipedia that is Franz. Great place to ride and a great person and people (you too Steph!!!) to ride with! Well, just had to round this section out with Franz nomming on some muffins from his hip-pack.</p>

    <h2 id="Brum">Bumming around in Brum (Birmingham)</h2>

    <p>Slowly but surely the world has opened up since the initial couple onslaught years of COVID. Since I'm over here in Europe in a different world, I know I need to start taking full advantage of that! That's been a slow build, but one way I've done that was through a quick weekend trip up to Birmingham, UK.</p>

    <p>One of Zack's great friends, Luke, was living up in Brum as his now fiancé was working for the Commonwealth Games. Not wanting to let the short distance go to waste, despite an initially canceled flight, I eventually made my way up to the UK for a weekend with Luke! Super awesome to be able to see him and hang out!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QIBGSv9h.jpg" alt="Over the Clouds"></img>

    <p>Once I landed I found the train, headed into town, and met up with Luke! He lived pretty close to the station, so we went and threw my bag in their apartment and then we hit the town walking. Apparently Brum has the reputation of being one of the worst cities in the UK, but with it all decked out in stuff for the Commonwealth Games, I didn't find it all that bad. Lots to see and check out, so we meandered our way through town.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/PnAtbr9h.jpg" alt="DownTown Brum"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/VdFYoTPh.jpg" alt="Intrepid Wanderers"></img>

    <p>Jelley, Luke's Fiance, was working as an organizer for the Commonwealth Games. I'd never thought about that as a job, but that's what she studied, and was all in deep with the planning and prep for the tournament. Despite the chaos and lack of sleep, we were able to pop over to the Games headquarters and say hi amidst one of her coffee breaks!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/bcxG86Vh.jpg" alt="Hey Jelley!"></img>

    <p>That afternoon, we jumped into a good 'ole double decker bus and headed out to meetup event Luke discovered. He was still pretty new in town, so he was being really proactive in finding things to do. The trip took us a bit out of town and over too a sweet outdoor bar place. Good music, some killer Jamaican food, some cold drinks, and even got to watch some lawn bowling as we sat around and chatted with some folks.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fU838Dsh.jpg" alt="Two-level Chariot"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/zItQwHxh.jpg" alt="Heated Lawn Bowling"></img>

    <p>One method Luke was using to get to learn Birmingham was a thing they had going called Key to the City. Essentially a promo-program that set up a ton of scavenger hunts all around town to get to know certain areas, landmarks, buildings, or who-knows-what. In our wandering, we ended up going to a couple of them in different parts of town, including one at a football stadium, one in a shopping mall, and one at an old postage house in a big park. Fun exploration all around.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ert8NHah.jpg" alt="Lead to the Tree"></img>

    <p>It was a quick weekend, but full of really great discussions, chats, adventures, walking, discoveries, and time to get to know Luke. Super fucking cool dude. To back up a little bit, although Jelley was there to work for the Commonwealth Games, they were on an open-ended world adventure that had been going on for a good year with no firm end in sight. Once the games were over, their adventure was set to continue, and through the chats about adventures and summer plans, I'd been invited to join along for one of them! More to come on that later :-)</p>

    <p>But soon enough, the weekend was over and I was back on the plane headed towards Germany. Great to see and hang out with Luke in the UK!!!</p>

    <h2 id="Vogel">Tour de Vogel - Third Time's the Charm</h2>

    <p>Tradition is tradition. Therefore, since summer was around, it was time for the third edition of the Tour de Vogel. Who can say no to some bikes on a beautiful day full of beer? No one. That's who.</p>

    <p>This year, along with Micha and Christoph, Micha's neighbor Stephan was along for the ride. As per usual, we geared up with snacks and goodies and good vibes, but got our pedal on after work one fine August evening. After pedaling from Work to Mischa's house, we polished off an appetizer beer, then hit the ground pedaling.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZAeHLbSh.jpg" alt="Citra Helles"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/p8uGCWLh.jpg" alt="Ready to Ride"></img>

    <p>In comparison to years past, and likely essentially due to the fact that it was a post-workday ride rather than a full day to roll between stops, our journey was a bit shortened. From Micha's place we rolled south down to the Seegugger for a quick drink then the Tour de Vogel started. First Ettlingen, then Durach, and finally in Karlsruhe.</p>
