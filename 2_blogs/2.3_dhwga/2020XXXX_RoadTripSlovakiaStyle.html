    <p>This whole Coronavirus thing really put a damper on life. As you all well know and have experienced in your own ways. It sucks. And unfortunately one aspect it affected my (and your life too, undoubtedly) is travel.</p>

    <a class="body_ctr" href="https://www.polarsteps.com/NialTilson/3638710-road-trip-slovakia-style?s=4B7AFAA4-CBFC-4672-8CFA-F6BF28433CC8">Spark Notes - My Polarsteps Journey</a>

    <h2 id="NewPlan">New Plan</h2>

    <p>I had initially planned to travel back to the (formerly) good 'ole USofA in July. Corona threw a gigantic wrench into those plans. First, my trip was four weeks long, a bit of work and a bit of family fun time. Kinda pointless to be stuck in quarantine for two out of those four weeks, and then to have been forced into another quarantine upon my return to Germany. That was the big downer of it all. The big sign of that trip likely not going to have happened despite my desire to make it happen - KLM straight up canceled my flight from Amsterdam to Portland and vice versa, and didn't tell me a damn thing about it...</p>

    <h3>The Decision Process</h3>

    <p>There was no way in hell I would have survived a full summer of not taking any time off. That just wasn't going to happen - I had to get out and about and do something adventurous and away from home. My first choice - two week road trip mountain biking and drinking whiskey in Scotland. Unfortunately, Scotland has had a two-week required quarantine in affect as well. That trip will have to wait until next summer. Seriously. I really want/need to make that happen.</p>

    <p>Next idea was Iceland. I looked at tickets and such and am really keen on making that happen at some point. I even debated taking the ferry from Denmark all the way over. But, as it is a expensive place to visit, and I wasn't quite up for driving around all on my own for two weeks, I opted out and decided to save Iceland for a later date.</p>

    <p>Those two ideas off the table, I was struggling to make a decision given the travel restrictions and limitations. At some point I shared my 'predicament' with my buddy Christoph, and he spits out, "Check out the High Tatras." No idea what he was talking about. Long story short, it's a small-ish but tall mountain range on the border of Slovakia and Poland. After looking a little more into it and the country, I was sold.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Christoph was super busy with school and studying, so he was unable to join. Still wanting to have someone along for the journey, I tried to figure out who'd be up for a fun little road trip around a tiny country. Long story short, I finally got to see my buddy Yann for the first time since moving back here, and he was down to adventure. BOOM BABY!</p>

    <h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>Corona really took a shit on my vacation and work hours for the year. That's a point of clarification for a longer conversation, but in essence I lost some vacation and time off because of how things at work shook out with the virus. But, I was able to squeak out two weeks of vacation at work and still have something left for the holidays, and Yann was itching for a good long time off, and was able to combo this trip sprinkled in with some more time off afterwards.</p>

    <p>If you look at Slovakia on a map, it's not a huge country. But taking a quick google search of the place, you'll see that there's actually a fair amount of stuff to get into, explore, taste, and experience over there. To try and plan out our road trip from thin air, we researched some of the highlights, pinned them on a google map, and decided on a counter-clockwise route starting and ending in Bratislava.</p>

    <p>Other than that, not a whole ton of planning. A few waypoints on a map, a date when we were starting and a date we wanted to get back by, and that was it. Off to Slovakia we went.</p>

    <h2 id="OntheRoad">On the ROAD AGAIN!!!</h2>

    <p>Slogging through work, it was honestly a long stretch leading up to taking off. The week beforehand involved a workshop in WÃ¶rth, and since I was the only guy on my component on-site, I had to cover for a lot of stuff. All of that stress also included getting a flat on my bike sometime during that week on my way to work. Good thing we've got a department Sprinter and some good colleagues to come pick up a stranded biker on the highway. It was busy, and frustrating in a few ways, but made the time go by relatively quick.</p>

    <p>But, finally, the day had arrived. I worked from home as I wrapped up the last details and figured out how and what to pack for two weeks on the road with Rupert and Yann, and making sure I was set for backpacking, city exploring, and everything(-ish) in between. Yann was also swamped leading up to the time off, so instead of heading over to Stuttgart that Friday night, we crashed at our own places and got things started early on Saturday.</p>

    <p>An early rise and prep through everything into the car, and we were off!!! It was a easy breeze over to Stuttgart (thank you early morning Autobahn), so I hung out there with him for a bit before loading up Rupert and getting underway. So it begins!!!</p>

    <p>It's kind of a cop out way to describe it, but the drive really went by pretty fast. Despite a couple splotches of traffic before we got to Ulm, we cruised through southern Germany and made it over to Austria in no time. Bought our little vignette to drive in Austria and Yann took over as we we cruised through rural Austria, then back to their autobahn, and thanks to some help from This American Life, we made it over to Vienna in a jiffy!</p>

    <p>Once we got there, we weren't sure of our plans for the city other than walking around and checking it out. Parking garage found, Rupert parked, we hit the street and started strolling around.</p>

    <p>If you need to know anything about Vienna, it's that there are big old buildings all over the place (imo they kinda blended together a bit) and big parks all over the place too. At least from an initial evaluation. And they were all welcomed, as it produced such a fantastic combination for exploration. In addition to that, there are bike thoroughfares everywhere. Big, wide, nice ones, right along the main streets and some of the smaller ones too. That was surprising and really cool to see.</p>

    <p>We were parked pretty close to the center of town, so we started our wandering strolling through the big park in front of what seemed to the museum area. Huge buildings, ornate features, a gigantic plaza and park, and people strewn about (mostly adhering to the distancing guidelines).
