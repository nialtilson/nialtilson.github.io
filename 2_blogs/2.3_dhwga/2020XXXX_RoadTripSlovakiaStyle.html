    <p>This whole Coronavirus thing really put a damper on life. As you all well know and have experienced in your own ways. It sucks. And unfortunately one aspect it affected my (and your life too, undoubtedly) is travel.</p>

    <a class="body_ctr" href="https://www.polarsteps.com/NialTilson/3638710-road-trip-slovakia-style?s=4B7AFAA4-CBFC-4672-8CFA-F6BF28433CC8">Spark Notes - My Polarsteps Journey</a>

    <h2 id="NewPlan">New Plan</h2>

    <p>I had initially planned to travel back to the (formerly) good 'ole USofA in July. Corona threw a gigantic wrench into those plans. First, my trip was four weeks long, a bit of work and a bit of family fun time. Kinda pointless to be stuck in quarantine for two out of those four weeks, and then to have been forced into another quarantine upon my return to Germany. That was the big downer of it all. The big sign of that trip likely not going to have happened despite my desire to make it happen - KLM straight up canceled my flight from Amsterdam to Portland and vice versa, and didn't tell me a damn thing about it...</p>

    <h3>The Decision Process</h3>

    <p>There was no way in hell I would have survived a full summer of not taking any time off. That just wasn't going to happen - I had to get out and about and do something adventurous and away from home. My first choice - two week road trip mountain biking and drinking whiskey in Scotland. Unfortunately, Scotland has had a two-week required quarantine in affect as well. That trip will have to wait until next summer. Seriously. I really want/need to make that happen.</p>

    <p>Next idea was Iceland. I looked at tickets and such and am really keen on making that happen at some point. I even debated taking the ferry from Denmark all the way over. But, as it is a expensive place to visit, and I wasn't quite up for driving around all on my own for two weeks, I opted out and decided to save Iceland for a later date.</p>

    <p>Those two ideas off the table, I was struggling to make a decision given the travel restrictions and limitations. At some point I shared my 'predicament' with my buddy Christoph, and he spits out, "Check out the High Tatras." No idea what he was talking about. Long story short, it's a small-ish but tall mountain range on the border of Slovakia and Poland. After looking a little more into it and the country, I was sold.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Christoph was super busy with school and studying, so he was unable to join. Still wanting to have someone along for the journey, I tried to figure out who'd be up for a fun little road trip around a tiny country. Long story short, I finally got to see my buddy Yann for the first time since moving back here, and he was down to adventure. BOOM BABY!</p>

    <h3>The Plan</h3>

    <p>Corona really took a shit on my vacation and work hours for the year. That's a point of clarification for a longer conversation, but in essence I lost some vacation and time off because of how things at work shook out with the virus. But, I was able to squeak out two weeks of vacation at work and still have something left for the holidays, and Yann was itching for a good long time off, and was able to combo this trip sprinkled in with some more time off afterwards.</p>

    <p>If you look at Slovakia on a map, it's not a huge country. But taking a quick google search of the place, you'll see that there's actually a fair amount of stuff to get into, explore, taste, and experience over there. To try and plan out our road trip from thin air, we researched some of the highlights, pinned them on a google map, and decided on a counter-clockwise route starting and ending in Bratislava.</p>

    <p>Other than that, not a whole ton of planning. A few waypoints on a map, a date when we were starting and a date we wanted to get back by, and that was it. Off to Slovakia we went.</p>

    <h2 id="OntheRoad">On the ROAD AGAIN!!!</h2>

    <p>Slogging through work, it was honestly a long stretch leading up to taking off. The week beforehand involved a workshop in WÃ¶rth, and since I was the only guy on my component on-site, I had to cover for a lot of stuff. All of that stress also included getting a flat on my bike sometime during that week on my way to work. Good thing we've got a department Sprinter and some good colleagues to come pick up a stranded biker on the highway. It was busy, and frustrating in a few ways, but made the time go by relatively quick.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/fnGXNMuh.jpg" alt="Bike Fix in the Shop"></img>

    <p>But, finally, the day had arrived. I worked from home as I wrapped up the last details and figured out how and what to pack for two weeks on the road with Rupert and Yann, and making sure I was set for backpacking, city exploring, and everything(-ish) in between. Yann was also swamped leading up to the time off, so instead of heading over to Stuttgart that Friday night, we crashed at our own places and got things started early on Saturday.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/fdmPXmNh.jpg" alt="Shit on the table"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/XICm4BMh.jpg" alt="Rupert's Ready!"></img>

    <p>An early rise and prep through everything into the car, and we were off!!! It was a easy breeze over to Stuttgart (thank you early morning Autobahn), so I hung out there with him for a bit before loading up Rupert and getting underway. So it begins!!!</p>

    <p>It's kind of a cop-out way to describe it, but the drive really went by pretty fast. Despite a couple splotches of traffic before we got to Ulm, we cruised through southern Germany and made it over to Austria in no time. Bought our little vignette to drive in Austria and Yann took over as we we cruised through rural Austria, then back to their autobahn, and thanks to some help from This American Life, we made it over to Vienna in a jiffy!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BHyUKNSh.jpg" alt="First Sign for Wien!"></img>

    <h3 id="Wien">Wien aka Vienna</h3>

    <p>Once we got there, we weren't sure of our plans for the city other than walking around and checking it out. Parking garage found, Rupert parked, we hit the street and started strolling around.</p>

    <p>If you need to know anything about Vienna, it's that there are big old buildings all over the place (imo they kinda blended together a bit) and big parks all over the place too. At least from an initial evaluation. And they were all welcomed, as it produced such a fantastic combination for exploration. In addition to that, there are bike thoroughfares everywhere. Big, wide, nice ones, right along the main streets and some of the smaller ones too. That was surprising and really cool to see.</p>

    <p>We were parked pretty close to the center of town, so we started our wandering strolling through the big park in front of what seemed to be the museum area. Huge buildings, ornate features, a gigantic plaza and park, and people strewn about (mostly adhering to the distancing guidelines).</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/anLsyGNh.jpg" alt="Green Grass on a Beautiful Day"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/KOoabtyh.jpg" alt="Museum for something"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/jHW1InXh.jpg" alt="Kids on a Statue"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/OYmARymh.jpg" alt="Museum and Old Car"></img>

    <p>Another thing we noticed pretty quickly was the prominence of bike lanes. They weren't really bike lanes, but pretty much separate bike-only streets. It was awesome.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/Na2FsFPh.jpg" alt="Bike Street"></img>

    <p>Our stroll through the park took us past a ton of greenery, some statues, and other random things. We stopped at one pavilion with a cool statue and took a load off for a while. In front of us were a couple dudes filming what I thought was some kind of music video. They took a ton of takes of the same thing, but wasn't sure what they were doing other than lip syncing to something.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/vcwOQBrh.jpg" alt="Statue of a Proud Man"></img>

    <p>Then on the other side, there was a dude strumming on a spanish guitar throwing out some hypnotically relaxing and low-key vibes. It was a perfect set of sound waves for the moment.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Zjx1kLXh.jpg" alt="Spanish Guitar in the Park"></img>

    <p>After a while, the journey continued on. We walked past the Rathaus, where they were hosting some kind of film festival. Neither of us were up for forking over the cash for it, so we strolled by, found an allee, and headed down thataway.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/PvF1gnch.jpg" alt="Rathaus from Afar"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/LHV2puph.jpg" alt="Flowers and Buildings"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/WiT5jbAh.jpg" alt="Rathaus from not Afar, bid ad"></img>

    <p>Weird interaction on that street. Some dude walked past and as he did asked if I was Jewish. I said no (as I am not), and his reply, "then go away". No idea what the fuck that was about, but the dude was shady as shit so we just kept walking.</p>

    <p>At this point, walking along this gorgeous, broad allee, with bike streets and car streets all mixed it, I kinda got the feeling that all the buildings just kinda blended together. This may just be characteristic to that area of Vienna that we walked through, but it was not very vibrant and just gave a sterile, museum-like feel. Not all that spectacular.</p>

    <p>That all changed once that allee led us to the waterfront. Not sure why this was such a surprise to me, but we'd stumbled upon the Danube flowing through town, and it was quite a vibrant stretch! We had to hunt for a staircase down to the walkway, but once we got down off the street-level, it felt like a different world.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/zZSc2jQh.jpg" alt="Street to Walkway level"></img>

    <p>I've said it before, I'll say it again, and I think it will always be true - water immediately changes the feel and atmosphere of a city. This was very true in Wien. There was color everywhere, graffiti, artwork, a laid back vibe, tons of people walking and biking around, just a relaxed place to be. Cool too, as every square inch of wall in the area was covered with color and artwork.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/lq9DRXRh.jpg" alt="Chilling at the Water"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/8sppmF9h.jpg" alt="Sup wit it"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/zhCzgr7h.jpg" alt="Peek a Boo"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/0rnc9CDh.jpg" alt="The Eye and the Tree"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/cOeU2dnh.jpg" alt="Reflectobuilding with some cool reflections"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/pWwZAS8h.jpg" alt="Drugs ARE amazing"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/P7Dyt39h.jpg" alt="Reflectobuilding"></img>

    <p>Relaxing. Just really relaxing taking in the energy down by the water. Eventually though, the path took us directly back up to the street level. All good things come to an end, I guess. From there, we pointed our feet in the direction to complete our mini-loop around the city center. Then hunger struck. Uh oh.</p>

    <p>We weren't sure what we wanted until Google showed us that there was a Korean restaurant just around the corner. Once we saw that, it's like it'd been in our heads all along, so we made a bee-line for the place - <a class="body" href="https://goo.gl/maps/mepBVDQo92UGxcSr6">HAN</a>.</p>

    <p>No patio spots, but we snagged a table inside. BOOM BABY let's do this. I was a bit bummed to start because the Makgoli only came in a full bottle. Wasn't trying to get sloshed, but any shred of disappointment I had vanished very quickly. We started off with some kimchi and edamame to get the ball rolling. ZOMFG I love edamame. Nomnomnomnomnomnomnomnom.Then the bibimbop came. ZOMFG it was unbelievably delicious. So good, and so flavorful.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/Wf6TdtYh.jpg" alt="Yann and some Food"></img>

    <p>At some point, one of the waitresses (turned out to be the cookâs daughter) came out and noticed I like the hot sauce. Because of that, she brought me some special hot sauce thatâs extra hot. As she put it on the table I dipped my finger in it to give it a try, and she literally jumped back with a huge gasp! I tasted it, and it was amazing. Absolutely amazing. A bit of a nutty, pasty, smooth feel at the start, and then a good bit of delayed spice. So fucking good.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/dDqfXOth.jpg" alt="Da SAOSSSS"></img><br>

    <p>Turns out, she'd never seen someone be able to handle the sauce like that. Not trying to toot my own horn here, but sounds like my tongue is a little more spice-tolerant than the normal Vienna crowd that rolls up there. No joke, I asked if they had any bottles of the stuff. It was so good. Unfortunately, the answer was no...</p>

    <p>From HAN (I saved it on my map for any time I head back to Wien), we strolled through the city back to the car now in the dark. Tons of activity and action, and it was a delightful walk. Got back to Rupert through and started the last little stretch to make it to Bratislava!</p>

    <p>It's only an hour between these two country's capitols, but it was a pretty cool drive. Wasn't a ton to see because of the dark, but there were a ton of wind turbines along the way that only made themselves known via their synchronized red lights at the top. Wickedly cool seeing all that.</p>

    <p>We made it to the border, snagged our toll vignette, then made it to the suburbs of Bratislava to our AirBnB. We rolled up kinda late, but our host's son was super helpful getting us in to the apartment and set up. Yann and I played some backgammon, but then it was time to hit the sack.</p>

    <h3>Mini-GBD</h3>

    <p>Although I've been to Austria before, I've never done a segment of <em>Good, Bad, Different</em> for the country. This was kind of a bit too much of an abbreviated visit, especially since it was only to one city, but here we go!</p>

    <h4>Good</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Huge lanes devoted to bike streets. Essentially full car lanes or separate streets, which were usually separated and/or elevated from normal traffic. All of it only for bicycles. How dope.</li>
      <li>Tons of green space and water in the city</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Bad</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The parts of Vienna that I saw, in terms of architecture, really looked homogenous and started to truly blend together. Of course, there were differences in the details of the structures and such. But, if it wasn't some kind of highlighted historical building, they all seemed to be cut from the same white stone with the same architectural motif. This was surprising to experience, as Vienna is touted as a cultural landmark. I didn't expect it to all seem to be the same.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Different</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Most intersections made you cross what felt like five different crosswalks just to get to the other side of the road.</li>
      <li>There were so many freakin benches in the parks. Not sure if it was intentional because there needed to be so many places to sit, or if someone just went way overboard with it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Day1">Day 1 - Bratislava</h2>

    <p>As always, it was up and at 'em, ready to start this explration trip off. Yann and I woke up and got ready in a relaxed manner, then headed towards town. Once we started walking, we quickly realized that our AirBnB was in the embassy residence area of town, with seemingly every second block some country's coat of arms on a gate or something like that. Even without that, there were some pretty wicked homes as we made our way down the hill in towards the city center.</p>

    <p>Before we'd made it quite all the way down the hill and into town, we came upon the National Council building, what I took to equate to their Senate Chamber or something similar. We wandered around the plaza for a bit and checked out the cool statue, beautiful overlook of the city, cool view of the bridge, and entrance to the old castle. But, as hunger was starting to creep in, we kept going, intending to return later.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/uFIglkEh.jpg" alt="UFO Bridge in the Distance"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cqeeQn1h.jpg" alt="National Council"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/Xm4GCuzh.jpg" alt="Slovakian Flag"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/GWBcSslh.jpg" alt="The Old Castle"></img>

    <p>The last stretch to the city center was quick after that. Took us a bit of walking around (no sweat though, it was a gorgeous morning), but we found a decent little place. Nothing too spectacular, but the pancakes were pretty great, and I found out I'm not a fan of chemex coffee. But, satiated, time to explore!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/YoxblPxh.jpg" alt="The Historic Gate"></img>

    <p>Being in the capitol, and a historical one at that, we put on our walking boots and got our sightseeing on. The core of the city center was the historical area, with plenty of things to see. Being still somewhat early in the morning, it was also relaxing as we strolled around.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/IHG5vo2h.jpg" alt="Big Opera-type Building"></img>

    <p>We picked up a trail along a tree-lined allee as it took us back up towards St. Michael's Church - huge, tall, promiment, right in the middle of it all and visible from pretty much everywhere.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/9Lvyphbh.jpg" alt="St. Michael's"></img>

    <p>Right in front of the church was a little pavilion with some historical and informational boards showing how the area used to look, important events from the past, the role the church has (and other buildings had) played in the community, and other stuff. The most memorable thing for me though was the sign that showed how that area was at some point leveled to build the highway that ran right next to the church. The old Synagogue and tons of other assumingly significant and historical parts to the cities past just destroyed so they could build the UFO bridge and a freeway right through downtown. Crazy communist past...</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/QVqnqHxh.jpg" alt="Map of the destruction"></img>

    <p>From the church, we went up the stairs we cruised up and along the old city wall ramparts then curled back into the many plazas and narrow walkways that we encountered along the way. From there, we went back to the old tall tower/gate pictured above, but we couldn't find an entrance. Not sure if all the websites we read were lying, or that there just wasn't a lookout up top. Either way, that was out of the picture.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/zYfGlyIh.jpg" alt="St. Mike's through the Alleys"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/Kmr7wJQh.jpg" alt="Quiet Couple on a Walk"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/L4A9w2Jh.jpg" alt="Empty Street"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/My5NJ1zh.jpg" alt="Yellow Alleyway"></img>

    <p>We cruised and meandered our way through some historical buildings, along some slowly-more-populated streets, past some cool statues, and were having a laid back time of the beautiful morning.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/cWG0kTrh.jpg" alt="Lady with Friendly Statue"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/figjAkth.jpg" alt="Collonades"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/MCcH9Pih.jpg" alt="Horsies and Drayguns"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/LCfeyHyh.jpg" alt="The Sewer Man"></img>

    <p>At this point, some of our research came to the point of publication. Although we'd only been walking around for an hour or two at this point, we'd noticed that nearly every group of people also out and about had cones of ice cream in tow. No joke. It was almost everywhere. This suprpsied us, as Germany is seen as a pretty ice cream-friendly land, but Slovakia was blowing the dairy out of that comparison.</p>

    <p>My Momma didn't raise me to be no fool. So we circled back to an earlier ice cream dealer we'd seen, snagged a couple scoops, and posted up on the nearest bench. Nothing like the combination of ice cream and people watching.</p>

    <p>In our sweet spot, we got up and taversed over to the other side of the historic city center with the Blue Chapel as our destination. On the way, We saw some cool buildings and such, but the Blue Chapel was quite the exclamation point. It stuck out like a sore thumb, and was quite the interesting thing to see.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/UIdnsdah.jpg" alt="Soviet-ish Statue"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/i7m8tS9h.jpg" alt="Telescoping Building"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Bj7AkUph.jpg" alt="Blue Chapel from the corner"></img>

    <p>We hung around for a bit to admire the unique building and how it seemed, not out of place, but to just really stick out from everything around it. The blue paired with the clear skies quite well.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/fDRWMgLh.jpg" alt="Graffiti and the Blue Church"></img><br>
    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/onVj5odh.jpg" alt="Spire in the Trees"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/RCHTwqlh.jpg" alt="Another shot of the Church"></img>

    <p>Our plan from there was to head over to the other side of the river, walk around and explore a bit, and then make it over to the UFO Bridge to go up to the observatory deck. Step 1 then, cross the river. This was done via a really cool pedestrian/train bridge, aka the Old Bridge. I was loving the shapes and geometry of it paired with the sunshine and shadows, so I took my time in crossing and looking back.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/xCGOAKwh.jpg" alt="View down the Bridge"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/F6VvdOQh.jpg" alt="The other side of the bridge"></img>

    <p>As I've mentioned, the weather was gorgeous, so our walk back down the Danube over to the tower was perfectly delightful. Eventually, we made it to the tower, but it was closed for lunch. Bummer, but not really. Right next to the tower is a big park, so we headed over there.</p>

    <p>Being that it was around mid-afternoon, and that we'd been walking for a while, we just found a nice spot to sit down read, and take a nap. I'm always a fan of naps, so that's what I dove into. :-) Always the right choice. Soon enough though, the clock flew by and the bridge was open again. So we got up and moseyed back over to head up to the top.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/5J1jfZeh.jpg" alt="Park Pathway"></img><br>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/oa00wWLh.jpg" alt="City Crest?"></img>

    <p>As with everything, the whole process was a little more complicated than normal due to COVID, but we got our tickets and eventually found ourselves at the top. Quite the cool view of Bratislava and:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Parts of Austria</li>
      <li>Parts of Hungary</li>
      <li>A huge group of Plattenbaus next to a shopping center</li>
      <li>Great views up and down the Danube</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also cool at the top was a banner going around the deck stating that the UFO Bridge was part of the World Tower Federation (or some group like that). Turns out I'd been to a few of their partner towers! All-in-all, beautiful views on a beautiful day overlooking Slovakia's capitol!</p>

    <p>Our journey then took us back across the bridge in search of something near and dear to my heart - craft beer. As you'd expect, late afternoon, we got thirsty. And through our walking around during the day we'd noticed that good beer seemed to be somewhat-readily available. Naturally, we had to take part.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/sQ9qRJLh.jpg" alt="Beer Shop"></img>

    <p>On the other side of the highway from St. Michael's church (one of us had spotted it earlier...), we rolled up to a little craft beer bar and snagged a table outside. Fresh air, good company, and craft beer. Perfect recipe.</p>

    <p>Since I've been living in Germany, a beer-variety desert, for the last while, I've been missing all the variety and diversity of taste that comes with a craft beer culture. Naturally, I was excited to be back in a country that doesn't archaically limit themselves of taste and ingredients. Excited and happy to see options on the tap list, I snagged myself a Citra IPA. To be honest, it didn't really taste like one, but it still tasted great.</p>

    <p>We sipped our delicious liquids, watched the cars and people go by, saw a bunch of commmotion with some kind of VIP group at the church, and just enjoyed the moment until our glasses were empty. Back up and at 'em, from there we wandered through the small alleys up the back-paths back to the castle.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/hYzVRvJh.jpg" alt="VIP Somethingorother"></img>

    <p>The little stretch of buildings leading up to the castle were really cool and quaint. The vibe was quiet but comfy, so we took our time walking past the little bars and buildings on the way up the hill. The path then spit us out back at the National Council buliding, so we walked past that and into the castle grounds to explore.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/VZd75DPh.jpg" alt="Path to the Castle"></img>

    <p>Once we got into the fortress walls, we realized just how gigantic the castle is. Huge building, towering over us, not just upwards, but footprint as well. We walked around and took the building, the statues, and the view of the city in. Pretty cool spot. Was a bit of a bummer though that the castle gardens were closed for some kind of private event, but that's how it goes.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/Xv86g7jh.jpg" alt="Tucked-in Staircase"></img>

    <p>By this point dinner was on our minds. So from the castle we decided to try and find a way out and back down towards town in search of a good place to chow down. Unfortunately, it took us a bit of a while to find a path that didn't lead to someone's backyard, but eventually we found our way.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">
      <strong>Sidenote:</strong>  For some reason we ran into a ton of historical buildings, places of significance, etc., where people's houses were jammed right up to it. For example, trying to get out of the main castle there, some paths just led directly into people's courtyards. Not sure why a national historic site as a pheaux entrance/exit specifically for the people that live in those buildings, but it was pretty interesting/weird to see. Also, we weren't alone in trying to go down those paths to get out...
    </p>

    <p>Our first idea of a Steakhouse eneded up falling through. They were way too expensive. Trouble was, that put us in the terrible predicament of both being hungry and being on the search for food in the most touristy area. Not a good combo.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/KR8cfj8h.jpg" alt="The Tall Tiny Building"></img>

    <p>This perilous search took us past a few places that looked cool but were packed, that were eager to host us but we weren't interested, and similar situations. Somehow we got lucky though and stumbled upon a really quiet and small inner courtyard that ended up having a restaurant. No one was there other than the cook and waitress hanging out a table. We weren't sure they were open, but they waved at a table and we took a seat.</p>

    <p>Ended up being just what the doctor ordered. Amazing food, cheap beer, and a laid-back atmosphere. Hard to beat that!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/vXaWxh1h.jpg" alt="The Quiet Patio"></img>

    <p>Satiated and relaxed, we (I, at least) felt the sweet tooth coming on. We enjoyed the patio and the calm environment at the restaurant for a bit, then were on the hunt for dessert. Found a cafe with a tiny table outside and snagged an espresso and some cheesecake. Total win.</p>

    <p>Food and drink success with a little people watching while enjoying it all got us back on track for a little more walking around. Our route took us to a newer part of town from what we'd explored earlier in the day, and eventually we would up at the Presidential Palace.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/gUzEBORh.jpg" alt="Soldier Monument"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/iD5dlNLh.jpg" alt="Presidential Gardens"></img>

    <p>To my eyes, it was kinda weird to have a presidential residence in the middle of the city (and as I type this I remember the time I walked past the White House right in the middle of DC...). On the one hand it's a ceremonial sign that the president is connected to the people, yes. But how often do they actually get out and interact with their constituents, neighbors, and people nearby?</p>

    <p>We wandered around the gardens a bit, then headed back out to the neighborhoods on our way to the Slavin Monument. The journey there took us through some pretty neighborhoods and up a big hill on the edge of town, and eventually we had some sporadic views looking over Bratislava.</p>

    <p>Twas a bit of a bummer, as the monument itself was covered in scaffolding because of construction. That was a bit of a letdown. But walking around the monument complex was pretty calm and relaxing. The monument and complex is dedicated to the Soviet troops that helped liberate Bratislava from Nazi control in WWII, so there were tons of military insignias and plaques of fallen soldiers throughout the area.</p>

    <p>By the time we were on our way out from the monument complex, night was upon us. We'd done a ton of walking throughout the day, and were trying to decide if we were up for another drink somewhere, or just heading back to the AirBnb. After some deliberating as we walked past some wicked homes with some amazing views of town up on the ridge, we decided to call it a day and head back to crash.</p>

    <h2 id="Day2">Day 2 - Crossing the 'Dube then Nitra</h2>

    <p>You know how mornings go, we woke up and eventually got ready. For some reason our host showed up a good bit early and kinda rushed us out of the place. Oh well. Just meant we got an earlier start to the day.</p>

    <p>We packed up the car and then walked back down to the town center for some grub. Thankfully we opted to bring our rain jackets along for the ride, as it started raining right as we got into town. Our way to town took us back through the castle, and this time the gardens were open. So along with heading to breakfast, we got some rain-calmed scenery to take in along the way.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/M8M3KcCh.jpg" alt="The Castle Gardens"></img><br>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/z3G7ZrQh.jpg" alt="The Castle Once Again"></img>

    <p>We strolled in with our schnazzy jackets into the town center, then saw a Mondieu (I think that's where we'd got our sweet tooth on the night before). Rather than fight the battle of trying to find the best place to breakfast, we settled in there and had a delicious breakfast. Easy win.</p>

    <p>Grubbed up and ready for the day, we strolled around a bit more, exploring the now rainy town center. Just like the day before, it was beautiful. Rain is really soggy and damp, but it does add quite a nice vibe to things, as long as you've got the right clothing for it.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/K9bkVEgh.jpg" alt="Bratislava in one Shot"></img>

    <p>Once back to the car, we were off to the next stop in our adventure! We took the road out of town over the UFO bridge, then turned south to drive along the Danube. Kinda cool getting out of the big city, as things got much more authentic as soon as we did. Our first stop was just a bit outside of town along the river. Yann had found a cool art museum right on the river, so that's where we headed.</p>

    <p>Womp womp womp. Turns out the place was closed on Monday's. Good thing too, because it was Monday. :-/ Bummer. But we made the most of it by walking around the area and seeing what we could. Ended up having some cool things to see like a dam, boat launch, watersports park, and some more. The grey weather was perfect for just strolling around, taking in the mighty Danube, and teaching Yann about the amazing wonders of Sloppy Joes.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/pEeDzIMh.jpg" alt="Rupert Rockin' Out"></img>

    <p>We took our time exploring around and taking in the sites and sounds of that little area. But from there, we jumped back into Rupert and took the little road that continued south alongside the Danube. Kinda cool, as we were on a jetty that channeled the Danube down the river (the main boatway) which was on our left, and on our right was the orignal path of the Danube. And on the other side of that stretch of water was Hungary. Crazy.</p>

    <p>That little road took us along a pretty calm little stretch through some small towns and along the water, and eventually it was going to take us across the Danube. But the way it did that was via a bridge over some giant boat locks and a dam that spanned the whole river. We almost drove right through, but I flipped Rupert around to park so we could jump in and explore this civil engineering behemoth.</p>
