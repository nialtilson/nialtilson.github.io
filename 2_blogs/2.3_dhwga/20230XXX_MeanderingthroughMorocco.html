    <p>It has been an AWFULLY long time since I've written anything here. That being the case, I'm jumping ahead to the most recent adventure and gonna write that up before circling back to all that's happened in essentially the last year since I wrote something in mid-2022.</p>

    <p>That said, it's been a busy, chaotic, stressful, emotional, difficult, and weird time for me lately. All those things compounding forced my hand to jump on a plan and gtfo of town for a while. It'd been brewing in my mind for a good long while, and with the help of a couple holidays I pulled the trigger and bought some plane flights to Fes, Morocco. My first trip to the massive continent of Africa!!! Initially planned as only five days, a couple days before take-off I switched my return flight for a few days later to make a true mini-adventure out of the trip.</p>

    <p>As it seems to be now commonplace that anytime I'm off for a plane trip it HAS to start at the ass crack of dawn, I had to force myself up and out of bed at 03:00 to get cleaned up and off to the airport. This is not ideal. But I'm not sure how that always comes to be. Either way, I was able to get up from the many alarm clocks I set, get to the car, drive the short bit down to the Baden-Baden airport, and soon enough I was all checked in and ready to fly out.</p>

    <p>Just a quick three hours later and my first experience with RyanAir was complete (wasn't as bad as all the hype, but definitely gotta pay attention when buying your tickets). Luckily enough, there's a straight shot flight direct from Karlsruhe to Fes, Morocco. That was part of the search criteria in going for this adventure, and luckily enough it all worked out!</p>

    <p>With the window seat, despite my grogginess, I kept an eye out for the coastlines as we were traversing the skies. Soon enough, we'd passed over the coast of Spain, and just a few minutes later, the north coast of Morocco came and went. Shortly thereafter, touchdown, welcome to Africa!</p>
