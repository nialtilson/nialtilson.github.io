    <h1>THE WORLD IS BURNING, AND RIGHTFULLY SO</h1>
    <br>

    <p>The title says it all. So much going on right now, a lot of it throwing the world into turmoil. Some warranted, some providing an opportunity to help us shape the world into a better place. Dear god I hope we take advantage of it, but we'll see how things shake out. All a matter of contributing where we can to head towards a better, more equal future.</p>

    <p>With that in mind, here's what's been going on of late from this American in Foreign Land in a time of chaos. And, as with all of my posts, this was written on and off over the course of a few months. So if there's a bunch of skipping around and such.............</p>

    <p>To start, a quick update on...</p>

    <h2>...THIS NEW WEBSITE!!!</h2>

    <p>One of the projects I listed out on the last post for Corona activities was putting some work on my new website. It's been in my mind for quite a while, but with so much time available, and FINALLY finding the motivation and somewhat determination to sit down and crank it out, I did it! Here it is!!!</p>

    <p>There is still a lot to fill out. More posts to write (going back and documenting my many projects), a number of bugs to fix (<strong>happy to receive any and all feedback you may have!!!</strong>), some more tweaks and adjustments to make, but at least for now, it's in a workable state, and I'm super proud of it!!!</p>

    <p>One of the most time-consuming things connected with this was transferring over all of my old blog posts to this site. This was really the impetus of wanting my own website, so all of my content/stuff was under my roof, but finally getting to it was kinda surreal. That, and it was an absolutely amazing time doing it. Why?</p>

    <p>The transfer process involved a lot of copy-pasting, inserting HTML language, and all of the necessary stuff involved with that. But, once a post had been copied over and translated, and all the images were correctly linked, I went through and re-read all of my posts. This task had been on my to-do list for a very long time as well, and it was a perfect time and place to do it!</p>

    <p>Tons of reflection. It was really nice to go back and reflect on my life over the last 7 years. I started it up the first time I moved to Germany and got to experience so many amazing things and places and people, and have continued it up throughout my journey and experiences since. Countless things learned, people met, cultures experienced, adventures enjoyed, and so much more. Being able to go back and look on to what I've been able to see and do paired itself up nicely with the fact that...</p>

    <h2>...This Bearded Freak is 30</h2>

    <p>Yup. My birthday. Weird to think, but I have officially survived three decades here on Planet Earth. I don't know how, but I did. </p>

    <p>As I'm sure some of you have experienced, having a birthday during these times of pandemic and chaos was a little weird. Not a whole lot going on, not a big ability to get out and really celebrate, and just a general aura about that isn't the most festive of moods. Despite that, I had quite the nice day.</p>

    <p>Just like every good thing in my life, it started out with a little chat with my Mommy. :-) She gave me a call as I was waking up to wish me the best. I've said it before, I'll say it again, and nothing could be more true - she is easily, hands-down, no-contest, sure-winner Best Mommy in the World. Truth.</p>

    <p>Work that day was work. As it always is. This time a little more light-hearted than usual. But with Corona still thinning out our ranks, it was a fairly empty office compared to usual.</p>

    <p>That night though (and no we didn't break any Corona regulations or local laws), I invited a couple friends over to celebrate! When we were kids the Best Mommy in the World would let us choose anything in the world that we could have for dinner on our birthday night to celebrate. My choice, every time, was tostadas.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="" alt="The Spread"></img>

    <p>Commemorating this fact on the big 3-0, that's what I whipped up for my friends. As Mexican food is a foreign concept in Germany, they had no idea what it was. But they were about to find out. I fried up the tortillas on the Sunday, and then whenever that week we celebrated, and it was a great ol' time.</p>

    <p>Sarah, Sofia, and Christoph made great company, and the table was decked out in full feast fashion. Thankfully, all of them really liked it. And since cooking this made me remember all of the spices involved with making the ground beef so damn flavorful, I lived off of taco salad for a good two weeks following.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="" alt="Tostada Gang (Thanks Sarah!)"></img>

    <p>In all, it was a truly enjoyable and great day. Nothing like starting the day off with a call from Mommy, and then finishing it off with great friends and great food, that is truly a recipe for success. And for this, a great start to the fourth decade and thirtieth year of my life. :-)</p>

    <h3>Why am I Weird About My Birthdate?</h3>

    <p>I don't know where or how this started, but for some reason I am really weird and reluctant about sharing my birth date, or really any information related to when (calendar-wise) I was born. As I said, I don't know where that came from.</p>

    <p>Perfect example of this - Sarah, Sofia, and Christoph had no idea that it was my birthday until a few days after the fact. Somehow they found out or I told them or something. That night, I gave them the spiel about birthdays and dinner choice and tostadas, but never outrightly said it was my birthday. When it came up after the fact they felt really bad (which they definitely shouldn't have), and I put myself into a bit of reflection. Why am I so weird about this?</p>

    <p>As I said, I'm not sure where this developed. But, after thinking about it, and if I had to try and find a culprit somewhere, I think it has something to do with the following aspects of my life:</p>

    <p><strong>I've been on my own for quite a long time</strong>. Since moving away for college, I've been flying solo through most of it. I think this point goes deeper than I'll let onto here, but I've always had the feeling that I need to look out for, fend for, and take care of myself. Not sure how Birthday's fit into that, but the feeling of quasi-isolation or self-sufficiency maybe plays a role.</p>

    <p><strong>I've been single for a long time</strong>. This kinda plays into the previous point, as usually a romantic partner knows the most intimate aspects of your life. Well, not surprisingly, not having that removes one potential contact who knows you inside and out.</p>

    <p><strong>I don't really share much, especially something like this, unless it is requested of me</strong>. Naturally, this isn't true in all situations. But for the most part, I hold my cards close to my chest, show em if I need to, but for the most part play with a hidden hand. Kinda just how I roll, and this is likely a major contributor to why I'm weird about sharing my birthdate.</p>

    <p>There's likely a deeper problem there, something more fundamentally screwed up with my psyche, but I'll leave it at those three points for now.</p>

    <h3>Birthday Jealousy - Stupid</h3>

    <p>As May is the absolute best month of the year, it goes without saying that other amazingly amazing people were also born in the same month!!! This topic may or may not have to deal with May birthday's, but it's been a while since it happened, so just go with it.</p>

    <p>Well, in the course of other amazing people having their birthday, I was made well aware of that fact through actions from others notify me of that person's upcoming birthday and how to take part in celebrating. Well, through that, I got really jealous and a little sad that I didn't have someone kinda spreading my birthday news through friends to do something. This is a pretty dumb and selfish thought, but it kinda got to me.</p>

    <p>Why didn't I have someone sharing my birthday with people I know to do something for me? Why wasn't I special enough to have something unexpected done for me? Those were a couple of the thoughts going through my head. Well, look at the three bolded statements above, and that'll help clarify...</p>

    <p>Again, this is a very selfish and stupid thought to have go through my head. Besides, why the hell should I complain? I got a phone call from the greatest Mommy in the world! I got to have a relaxed, wonderful, and delicious meal with some amazing friends! I got to live and breathe and enjoy another day in this pandemic-ridden world we live in!</p>

    <p>Jealousy is one of the many things that can creep into my head when I let myself go and forget about the many amazing things and people I have in my life. But, I need to remember just that, that I have MANY amazing things and people in my life. No reason to be comparing myself to others when what I've got right in front of me is enough.</p>
