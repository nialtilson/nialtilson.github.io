    <h1>THE WORLD IS BURNING, AND RIGHTFULLY SO</h1>
    <br>

    <p>The title says it all. So much going on right now, a lot of it throwing the world into turmoil. Some warranted, some providing an opportunity to help us shape the world into a better place. Dear god I hope we take advantage of it, but we'll see how things shake out. All a matter of contributing where we can to head towards a better, more equal future.</p>

    <p>With that in mind, here's what's been going on of late from this American in Foreign Land in a time of chaos. And, as with all of my posts, this was written on and off over the course of a few months. So if there's a bunch of skipping around and such.............</p>

    <p>To start, a quick update on...</p>

    <h2>...THIS NEW WEBSITE!!!</h2>

    <p>One of the projects I listed out on the last post for Corona activities was putting some work on my new website. It's been in my mind for quite a while, but with so much time available, and FINALLY finding the motivation and somewhat determination to sit down and crank it out, I did it! Here it is!!!</p>

    <p>There is still a lot to fill out. More posts to write (going back and documenting my many projects), a number of bugs to fix (<strong>happy to receive any and all feedback you may have!!!</strong>), some more tweaks and adjustments to make, but at least for now, it's in a workable state, and I'm super proud of it!!!</p>

    <p>One of the most time-consuming things connected with this was transferring over all of my old blog posts to this site. This was really the impetus of wanting my own website, so all of my content/stuff was under my roof, but finally getting to it was kinda surreal. That, and it was an absolutely amazing time doing it. Why?</p>

    <p>The transfer process involved a lot of copy-pasting, inserting HTML language, and all of the necessary stuff involved with that. But, once a post had been copied over and translated, and all the images were correctly linked, I went through and re-read all of my posts. This task had been on my to-do list for a very long time as well, and it was a perfect time and place to do it!</p>

    <p>Tons of reflection. It was really nice to go back and reflect on my life over the last 7 years. I started it up the first time I moved to Germany and got to experience so many amazing things and places and people, and have continued it up throughout my journey and experiences since. Countless things learned, people met, cultures experienced, adventures enjoyed, and so much more. Being able to go back and look on to what I've been able to see and do paired itself up nicely with the fact that...</p>

    <h2>...This Bearded Freak is 30</h2>

    <p>Yup. My birthday. Weird to think, but I have officially survived three decades here on Planet Earth. I don't know how, but I did. </p>

    <p>As I'm sure some of you have experienced, having a birthday during these times of pandemic and chaos was a little weird. Not a whole lot going on, not a big ability to get out and really celebrate, and just a general aura about that isn't the most festive of moods. Despite that, I had quite the nice day.</p>

    <p>Just like every good thing in my life, it started out with a little chat with my Mommy. :-) She gave me a call as I was waking up to wish me the best. I've said it before, I'll say it again, and nothing could be more true - she is easily, hands-down, no-contest, sure-winner Best Mommy in the World. Truth.</p>

    <p>Work that day was work. As it always is. This time a little more light-hearted than usual. But with Corona still thinning out our ranks, it was a fairly empty office compared to usual.</p>

    <p>That night though (and no we didn't break any Corona regulations or local laws), I invited a couple friends over to celebrate! When we were kids the Best Mommy in the World would let us choose anything in the world that we could have for dinner on our birthday night to celebrate. My choice, every time, was tostadas.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/BJ7IiNbh.jpg" alt="Blurry Tostada Fixings"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/voinXgBh.jpg" alt="The Spread"></img>

    <p>Commemorating this fact on the big 3-0, that's what I whipped up for my friends. As Mexican food is a foreign concept in Germany, they had no idea what it was. But they were about to find out. I fried up the tortillas on the Sunday, and then whenever that week we celebrated, and it was a great ol' time.</p>

    <p>Sarah, Sofia, and Christoph made great company, and the table was decked out in full feast fashion. Thankfully, all of them really liked it. And since cooking this made me remember all of the spices involved with making the ground beef so damn flavorful, I lived off of taco salad for a good two weeks following.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/SxkvXf1h.jpg" alt="Tostada Gang (Thanks Sarah!)"></img>

    <p>In all, it was a truly enjoyable and great day. Nothing like starting the day off with a call from Mommy, and then finishing it off with great friends and great food, that is truly a recipe for success. And for this, a great start to the fourth decade and thirtieth year of my life. :-)</p>

    <h3>Why am I Weird About My Birthdate?</h3>

    <p>I don't know where or how this started, but for some reason I am really weird and reluctant about sharing my birth date, or really any information related to when (calendar-wise) I was born. As I said, I don't know where that came from.</p>

    <p>Perfect example of this - Sarah, Sofia, and Christoph had no idea that it was my birthday until a few days after the fact. Somehow they found out or I told them or something. That night, I gave them the spiel about birthdays and dinner choice and tostadas, but never outrightly said it was my birthday. When it came up after the fact they felt really bad (which they definitely shouldn't have), and I put myself into a bit of reflection. Why am I so weird about this?</p>

    <p>As I said, I'm not sure where this developed. But, after thinking about it, and if I had to try and find a culprit somewhere, I think it has something to do with the following aspects of my life:</p>

    <p><strong>I've been on my own for quite a long time</strong>. Since moving away for college, I've been flying solo through most of it. I think this point goes deeper than I'll let onto here, but I've always had the feeling that I need to look out for, fend for, and take care of myself. Not sure how Birthday's fit into that, but the feeling of quasi-isolation or self-sufficiency maybe plays a role.</p>

    <p><strong>I've been single for a long time</strong>. This kinda plays into the previous point, as usually a romantic partner knows the most intimate aspects of your life. Well, not surprisingly, not having that removes one potential contact who knows you inside and out.</p>

    <p><strong>I don't really share much, especially something like this, unless it is requested of me</strong>. Naturally, this isn't true in all situations. But for the most part, I hold my cards close to my chest, show em if I need to, but for the most part play with a hidden hand. Kinda just how I roll, and this is likely a major contributor to why I'm weird about sharing my birthdate.</p>

    <p>There's likely a deeper problem there, something more fundamentally screwed up with my psyche, but I'll leave it at those three points for now.</p>

    <h3>Birthday Jealousy - Stupid</h3>

    <p>As May is the absolute best month of the year, it goes without saying that other amazingly amazing people were also born in the same month!!! This topic may or may not have to deal with May birthday's, but it's been a while since it happened, so just go with it.</p>

    <p>Well, in the course of other amazing people having their birthday, I was made well aware of that fact through actions from others notify me of that person's upcoming birthday and how to take part in celebrating. Well, through that, I got really jealous and a little sad that I didn't have someone kinda spreading my birthday news through friends to do something. This is a pretty dumb and selfish thought, but it kinda got to me.</p>

    <p>Why didn't I have someone sharing my birthday with people I know to do something for me? Why wasn't I special enough to have something unexpected done for me? Those were a couple of the thoughts going through my head. Well, look at the three bolded statements above, and that'll help clarify...</p>

    <p>Again, this is a very selfish and stupid thought to have go through my head. Besides, why the hell should I complain? I got a phone call from the greatest Mommy in the world! I got to have a relaxed, wonderful, and delicious meal with some amazing friends! I got to live and breathe and enjoy another day in this pandemic-ridden world we live in!</p>

    <p>Jealousy is one of the many things that can creep into my head when I let myself go and forget about the many amazing things and people I have in my life. But, I need to remember just that, that I have MANY amazing things and people in my life. No reason to be comparing myself to others when what I've got right in front of me is enough.</p>

    <h2>Project Update</h2>

    <h3>Vertical Bike Stands</h3>

    <p>As you'll notice in the menu bar of this schnazzy new website, there is a link to a "Projects" page. Well, the meat of this section will eventually be located there, so I'll round this section out with a couple quick pictures of my schnazzy new bike stands!!! And the toy I got to buy to help build them. ;-)</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/TMEGCmMh.jpg" alt="Bike Stands"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/9zMIJvYh.jpg" alt="Saw it Up"></img>

    <h3>Bike Rebuilds</h3>

    <p>Having the first few weeks of the pandemic at home and it being pre-summer bike season, I took the chance to do a bit of an overhaul on both of my bikes. As with any work on the bike, I was missing parts, had the wrong parts, had to wait for parts, needed more parts, and struggled with getting it all done some times, but it all got done. So what all did I do?</p>

    <p>To start, I had to swap the brake sets. On my commuter (aka hardtail, that's more mountain bike than road bike), when I built it up I put on a brake set that was essentially Downhill-bike ready. On my actual mountain bike, I had a more tame brake set built in. So, to make the brake sets match the riding to happen on each bike, that required a swap.</p>

    As this was a pretty invasive operation, I thought "Well, if I'm going that far, let's go all the way." So a simple brake swap turned into (FS for Full Suspension aka Mountain Bike, HT for Hardtail aka "road" bike):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>FS - A complete replacement of the suspension pivot bearings</li>
      <li>FS + HT - Full Brake swap</li>
      <li>FS - Brake caliper piston teardown and clean</li>
      <li>FS - Headset bearing replacement (including a rushed drive over to the last bikeshop in town with the correct bearing)</li>
      <li>FS + HT - Full frame cleaning</li>
      <li>FS + HT - Full degrease and clean of drivetrain</li>
      <li>HT - New Fender install (ones that actually keep the rain off your feet)</li>
    </ul>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/6NzYouRh.jpg" alt="A clean Suspension and Drivetrain"></img>

    <p>It was a lot of work, but fun work. Working on my bikes is (almost) always fun. It's something I can tinker with, build, rebuild, and then enjoy constantly once it's complete. So dope.

    <h3>Workshop Setup</h3>

    <p>The bike stands helped clear up some space and establish some organization to the room. With those hung and out of the way (and finally rebuilt and fixed during Corona so I could clean things up a bit), I received the newest addition to the workshop, my wicked cool new tool chest.</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/TU4ZBSPh.jpg" alt="New Tool Chest"></img>

    <p>SOOOOO pumped to have this new rig. Finally, all my tools in essentially the same space. My bike tools didn't all fit, but all my standard tools squeezed in. All in one spot, in my workshop. HOW FRIGGIN COOL!?!?!? This level of organization really made and makes working on my bikes and whatever little tinkering I do feel so much more organized, efficient, and cool. Not sure how, but it does.</p>

    <p>Bike stands build, new tool chest with all my tools in it, really, that's all I needed. Sorry guest room, but you've been replaced with a Workshop. :-)</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/rGyZeINh.jpg" alt="Organized Workshop"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/AyLxjfyh.jpg" alt="Nial at Work"></img>

    <p>The bad part about having a nice workshop to work in? Now I really want a full garage. More space, more tools, more fun. That'll come with time, but being impatient is a bitch.</p>

    <h3>Picture Labeling</h3>

    <p>This one has kinda taken a back seat. It's a bit tedious and time consuming (holy shit I've got a ton of pictures...), so the lazy dude in me usually just kinda pushes this off to the next time I've got time to do this. Unsurprisingly, I haven't made much headway.</p>

    <h3>Trek Mileage Markers</h3>

    <p>Similar with all projects, I'd pushed this one off for quite some time. Finally, a month or so ago (June-ish), I finally busted out my sewing machine and was gonna get to work. I had a few things I needed to stabilize, fix, and sew up, so I think reaching critical mass of things to do helped out here.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/w55fFDyh.jpg" alt="Sewing Setup"></img>

    <p>Well, it took me a while to get things working and figuring out the new machine.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">
      <strong>Sidenote:</strong> Thanks Mommy for helping me get a sewing machine!!! One more notch to add on my Jack-of-all-Trades belt!
    </p>

    <p>But once I got rolling, I tackled some smaller stuff first. I had to fix my lanyard so it wouldn't just randomly lose my keys at some point in time, then did some touch-ups on my daily backpack. Some of the seams were coming undone, so some very rough fixes helped patch that up and get me on my way!</p>

    <img class="vert" src="https://i.imgur.com/CXvRwa1h.jpg" alt="Fixed Lanyard"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/T3jN6Dvh.jpg" alt="Backpack Fix"></img>

    <p>The next item was to do some mileage markers for the treks I'd been on. So I whipped out my trekking backpack, and was ready to get to work. Due to the amazing wisdom of my Mommy, I did a little research beforehand to look into the specs of my backpack - was it water repellent or special in that sense?</p>

    <p>After a little googling and REI support, I discovered that the outer fabric (notably where I was going to stich in the markers) was in fact water repellent. Why does that matter, you ask? Well, if I poke a bunch of holes into a water repellent fabric and string some thread through it, that kinda kills the water repellency for that area. Bummer.</p>

    <p>That little tidbit of knowledge has essentially forced me to put this idea on ice. My backup idea was just to use different colored sharpies, but that's not nearly as cool. If you have any ideas of how I could put tick marks for every five miles onto my bag that is kinda meaningful and cool, that'd be dope. But in the meantime, this'll have to wait.</p>

    <h3>Video Games</h3>

    <p>The Last of Us was the first game I was trying to get through in Corona Times. That was a great game, and had a helluva cliffhanger/surprising ending, but was fun to play through.</p>

    <p>After that, I splurged and got the full Red Dead Redemption 2 pack, and loved going through that one. That was the perfect game for Corona Times too, as you're an outlaw exploring the Wild West. Being cooped up on the couch, being able to vicariously explore a fictitous land was quite the fantastic proxy adventure. I still haven't finished the storyline of that game yet, but it's been a great game to work through!</p>

    <p>At some point, I started up Horizon: Zero Dawn. It took a few sessions to get into it, but it being another Open-World game has been pretty fun. You're a warrior chick wandering around a post-apocalyptic world where humans have diverted back to a nomadic tribal lifestyle as demonic machines terrorize the world, and you've got to figure out how to fix it. Pretty dope.</p>

    <p>In my game choice, I've realized that Open-World games are my jam. The choices are yours to make - what to do, where to go, and when to do it. Because of this, I'm a very turn-every-stone kind of play. This stemmed from my days playing Red Alert 2 and such, where I made sure I went everywhere on the map to know what was there and have it all on my radar. This hasn't changed, as I make sure to be aware of whatever's going down.</p>

    <h2>Other Updates</h2>

    <h3>Apartment</h3>

    <p>Not a whole lot to update on my apartment. It's still cozy, comfy, and at a livable level. I've realized black tile floor is really fucking annoying to keep clean.</p>

    <p>I've got a few projects yet on my list that I eventually want to tackle. Here's that list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A bar-style table for the kitchen to go with the bar stools I bought. I want to make the legs adjustable so the table can be a bit versatile, but need to do some digging on the best way to make that happen</li>
      <li>A stand-up desk  --- BUILT IT. Aka bought the legs on Amazon and bolted it all together. Regardless, it's dope</li>
      <li>A hanging table for my balcony. Something that can hang on the wall of my balcony, with a table that is essentially a bar table, but that can fold down flat against the wall when not being used</li>
      <li>Something garden/green-related for the balcony. The idea of a hydroponics system was/is floating around in my mind, but need to flesh that idea out</li>
      <li>I'm sure there's more, but they're not coming to mind right now</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One bad note. When I had taken my desk apart to build the standing desk, I had/have the sides and back of the desk still hanging around. Well, vaccumming one day, I had the largest piece stood up against the wall. I pulled on the electrical cord, it tightened up against that piece leaning on the wall, and down it came. It ended up punching a hole in the wall a few coins wide. My landlords were super chill about it / not pissed, so it's just a constant reminder to think things through before you start yanking on electrical cords.</p>

    <h3>Wheels</h3>

    <p>My little four-wheel Volkswagen is rolling along quite nicely! We've already been on a few little road trips down to the Alps (in Germany) so far, but I've done a few things to help christen it.</p>

    <p>First, and I'm not sure how they keep popping up, but I keep finding scratches on it. Mostly on the back bumper. No, I'm not running into people when I park, but I'm not sure where they're coming from, and there seem to be more every time I look at it. That's annoying.</p>

    <p>As I had on Marvin back home, I had to put on a bumper sticker. And not just ANY bumper sticker, I had to stick with tradition. So that's what I did. Shout out to Milwaukee, WI.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/74dPqwTh.jpg" alt="It's Not Just for Breakfast"></img>

    <p>The next important thing was related to biking. I knew I had to graduate from the days of taking apart my bike to be able to transport it. Andy, your constant shit-giving on this point made it pretty clear. Well my vehicle didn't have a hitch, so I focused on the roof-rack variety. This is bad because they get worse gas mileage, but good because you can still use the truck with a bike strapped on.</p>

    <p>My good buddy Franz came through HUGE in the clutch on this, as he has on so many other things! Somehow this came up in conversation, and he said he had the whole setup hanging out in his basement. A quick stroll by, fitting it onto the roof, and I was sold. Now, I'm a grown-up! I can go biking and strap my bike to the roof!!!</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/1xFqVbIh.jpg" alt="New Roof Rack"></img><br>
    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/pSQVjbEh.jpg" alt="Rack in Use"></img>

    <p>The last main piece I had to work on was a name. Nothing was really sticking. I got a bunch of suggestions from some friends, a bunch of golf-related nicknames, and some others as well, but I couldn't decide. I wanted something that you could pronounce similarly in English and in German, and it had to fit. The new name had been an idea for a while, but after enough toying with it in my mind, I'm making it stick. World, meet Rupert :-)</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/Fe4dUslh.jpg" alt="Rupert"></img>

    <p><em>Well, what else has been going on?</em> Let me see if I can remember...</p>

    <h2>JUS GUNNA SEND IT</h2>

    <p>I've been biking quite a good bit lately. And surprisingly it's been a good mixture of on-road and off-road.</p>
