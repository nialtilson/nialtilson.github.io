      <strong>My first</strong>:<br>
      <em>COIL SUSPENSION BIKE</em><br>

    </p>

    <p>After my 2017 Patrol decided to ring its death bell, I had to find a new ride, and fast. There was no way I could go for an extended period of time without a ride-worthy mountain bike.</p>

    <p>Before I left Scotland (and essentially as soon as the 2017 frame broke), I jumped on the webertubez to see if I could find a replacement. As I was currently in the UK at that time, I had a higher chance of finding another Transition, and the hope was to get something on the way in order to save on import fees.</p>

    <p>As luck would have it, I contacted a guy with a frame, was able to set up a time to meet on my drive back home, and long story short, I was in business! Luckily enough I got the frame through the customs checkpoint without issue, and as soon as I got home it was time to start the upfit.</p>

    <h2>The Build</h2>

    <p>After getting the frame, and having a broken existing frame :,-( from my 2017 Patrol, it was time to go a little Frankenstein on the new one.</p>

    <p>The only things wrong with my old bike were the frame (pretty glaring and obvious), the drivetrain, and the wheels. The wheels, the last time I tried to get them trued up before heading down to France, the bike tech essentially called me freaking out (and a bit pissed off) that they were so out of whack. The drivetrain was just old and pretty worn down. But, that mean the whale's majority of the parts could just be taken off and put on the new frame!</p>

    <p>As soon as I got back from Scotland, I went to work tearing down the old frame. I made fairly quick work of all the parts (except for the one bottom bracket cup), and even went so far as to tear out all the bearings and keep the good ones. With the frame torn down and in pieces, I boxed it up and sent it off to Transition to get myself in line for a brandy-spanking new bike. We'll see how that plays out. So long, you valiant, trustworthy, and incredible bike...</p>

    <p>Viking burial complete, time for the phoenix to rise from the ashes! Here. We. Go. With the new frame on the stand, it was a slow process of slowly getting everything pressed, screwed, and installed on it. Unfortunately, the previous owner really did a number on the bearings. So first things first was a complete overhaul of the suspension and bearing replacement. Easy enough. I'm really lucky to have all the tools I need, and slowly but surely, this new ride started to look more and more like a bike!</p>

    <p>My trusty bike buddy Andy gave me some guidance on brake hoses and a few beers during building helped whiddle down the final details and get this thing closer to being read. Once the wheels came in, I was all set! I got the cassette installed, new tires sealed on, and this baby was ready to ride!!!</p>

    <p>To say I was happy, stoked, and relieved to have a functional enduro bike back in my quiver is a total understatement. I was so pumped, and after the first ride, knew this was going to be one helluva bike!</p>
