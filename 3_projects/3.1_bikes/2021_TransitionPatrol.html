      <strong>My first</strong>:<br>
      <em>N/A</em><br>

    </p>

    <p>After my 2017 Patrol decided to ring its death bell, I had to find a new ride, and fast. There was no way I could go for an extended period of time without a ride-worthy mountain bike.</p>

    <p>Before I left Scotland (and essentially as soon as the 2017 frame broke), I jumped on the webertubez to see if I could find a replacement. As I was currently in the UK at that time, I had a higher chance of finding another Transition, and the hope was to get something on the way in order to save on import fees.</p>

    <p>As luck would have it, I contacted a guy with a frame, was able to set up a time to meet on my drive back home, and long story short, I was in business! Luckily enough I got the frame through the customs checkpoint without issue, and as soon as I got home it was time to start the upfit.</p>

    <h2>The Build</h2>

    <p>After getting the frame, and having a broken existing frame :,-( from my 2017 Patrol, it was time to go a little Frankenstein on the new one.</p>
