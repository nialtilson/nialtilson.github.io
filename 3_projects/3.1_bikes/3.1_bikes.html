    <h1>BIKES</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      Biking has been a love of mine since wayyyyy early on in life. Earliest memories go all the way back to our first house in Olympia. My first real bike, some orange rigid thing for kids, was the source of way too many days of speed, tight curves, skinned knees, and a wealth of scars. Wouldn't trade those days for the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can't remember exactly when, but I think when I turned 12, my parents got me my first 'real' bike - a 2002 Giant Rincon. It was a 26" wheeled-beast, and is something that solidified my love for biking. I've had to rebuild it a few times, but it's still in my stable.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to my Rincon, I've added a couple more bikes to the quiver since then, and these pages are tributes to the builds, longevity, and great times I've had with all of my two-wheeled steeds.
