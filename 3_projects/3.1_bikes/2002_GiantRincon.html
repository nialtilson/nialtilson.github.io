    <p>This bike, as I said, has been along for the ride with me through life for quite the long time. NO idea how many miles and trails I've put on it, but it is sure a hefty sum.</p>

    <img class="horz" src="https://i.imgur.com/6WV4482h.jpg" alt="Brown County I think"></img>

    <p>Because I've had it a long time, I've had to do a ton of work on it too. That means this beast has been my guinea pig and learning tool for many a different required repair and maintenance topic. Thankfully, I've been able to make sure she's always been put back together correctly and able to continue riding on for another day!</p>

    <h2>The Overhaul</h2>

    <p>After many a long ride, and after moving back to Portland after my rotation program, I got this 'ole bike back into service. As you'd imagine though, after years of riding on the same parts, eventually things started to deteriorate. At that point, I had a decision. The thing that needed replacing was the drivetrain so I could replace that, get a new bike, or wallow in sorrow that my bike was waning.</p>

    <p>Wasn't ready for a new bike yet, so I went for a fully different option - the complete overhaul. And I mean complete. I was going to make this bike brandy-spanking new and ready to roll.</p>

    <p>It was a long project, but a lot of fun. Thankfully at that time, I had access to our workshop with tons of tools and especially to a sandblaster, so I tore everything down and cleaned it all up to get ready for some powder-coating. Getting the paint off was an absolute bear, but a little persistance and a ton of chemical paint-stripper, and I was in business!</p>

    <p>Soon enough, I'd gotten the goods back from the powder-coater, and oooooooooooh baby was it looking good!</p>

    <p>Rebuilding time. I had ordered all the parts I needed ahead of time, and at that point it was time for the kitchen/living-room bike shop to come to full service. And that it did.</p>

    <p>After a lot of love, blood, sweat, and tears, my ride was back in order and ready to rip!</p>

    <h2>Legacy Ride</h2>

    <p>Writing this up, I'm in Germany with my Patrol and Honzo, but this good 'ole Rincon is back at home in the USofA. She's boxed up and in storage, but still a trusty ride that I'll hold on to.</p>

    <p>Sadly, as I was getting her boxed up to put into storage, I learned from the bike shop that the rims were pretty far along in cracking almost the whole way around. On the one side it's not surprising, as they are still the stock rims from '02. On the other side, it sucks to know there's a little more TLC that she'll need if she's going to be ride-worthy when I get back.</p>

    <p>A rim replacement is totally do-able, but that'll totally depend on what other projects and goings-on I'll have ahead of me when I move back and pull her out of the box. We'll see if her riding days will continue, or if they've been over for a while.</p>

    <p>At the very least, that frame will for sure become a wall ornament somewhere for me. This bike has gotten me through some tough times, good times, fun times, and stressful times. And hot damn she's been quite the treat.</p>
