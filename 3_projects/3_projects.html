    <h1> PROJECTS </h1>

    <p>
      Hopefully those that know me would agree. But if not, well, too bad. I
      consider myself a tinkerer; I like to build, make, fix, all that kinds of
      stuff. Because of that, I'm commonly finding myself in the midst of a
      project. As you would expect, most of those projects are riddled by poor
      definition, drastic project creep, sometimes too deep attention to
      detail, and god knows what other common failures of personal projects.
      Despite that, I love it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the interest of not trying to hoard everything for myself, and maybe
      provide some motivation, ideas, tips, or tricks to fellow builders and
      tinkerers, I figured I might as well try and document that which I build,
      fix, create, or whatever else my hands end up working with to stay
      occupied.
