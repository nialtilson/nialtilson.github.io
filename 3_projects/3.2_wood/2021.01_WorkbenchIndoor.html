    <h2 id="Background">Background / Motivation</h2>

    <p>My apartment here in Karlsruhe is great. But, it's an apartment, which doesn't come with a garage or a shop or anything like that. Before I moved in, I initially planned on having the extra room as a guest room, but living on my own, 98% of the time it's just me. What's that mean? Turn it into a workshop!</p>

    <p>The one thing I didn't have, that every workshop needs is a good workbench. I'd been using my kitchen table and my desk as one for a good long while, and both of those filled the role quite well. But being capable, willing, and ready to take on another project, I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands and build myself a useful, custom workbench.</p>

    <h2 id="Requirements">Project and Design Requirements</h2>

    <h3>Size</h3>

    <p>Space was the biggest limitation and constraint for this build. The room of my workshop is thin and long. Paired with that, I've got my desk taking up a good amount of space, and my bike stands and the bikes hanging on them stick out a good bit taking up a good amount of space. With that, I had two sides of the room I could build it on. After paring it all down, I decided on a <strong>width of <em>1350mm</em></strong> and a <strong>depth of <em>600mm</em></strong>. Both dimensions allow me to have a good bench size and still maintain some space to move around.</p>

    <p>Height was a tough choice. Workbench height is a variable topic, which as I started my googling, has a very variable result. After some digging, essentially it comes down to what kind of work you want to do on the workbench. One of the <a class="body" href="https://extranet.fredhutch.org/en/u/ehs/hamm/chap8/section5.html">references</a> I checked out (<a class="body" href="https://www.theenglishwoodworker.com/workbench-height/"> and another one</a>) split it all down by the type of work you're doing on it, Heavy, Light, or Precise. This bench is really gonna be used for a bit of everything. So, after some more hemming and hawing, measuring my dropped-hand length, and all that stuff, I settled on a roughly average <strong>height of around <em>945mm</em></strong>.</p>

    <h3>Form</h3>

    <p>A couple things that kinda relate to the size decision were a couple pieces that I had to incorporate into the piece in order to still make that space viable and usable - my tool chest and my file cabinet. both of those are fairly big and bulky, so somehow being able to incorporate these two big boxes into the workbench were a constraint.</p>

    <p>In order to do that, I wanted to build the bench <strong>with an open core</strong>, something with a big opening to utilize as a storage space. Due to the height of the tool chest, it had to be from the ground up and not through a shelf or anything. With that in mind, that also led to the Length, Width, and Height designs, but also dictated the dimensions of the materials to be used.</p>

    <h3>Feature - Assembly</h3>

    <p>One thing in the back of my mind is the portability of this unit. First and foremost, the thing's gotta be built like a tank. I'm good at that kinda construction. But it also has to be portable to the point I can get it in and out of a dwelling, as I'm more than likely going to move at some point again in my life and would like to take this with me.</p>

    <p>So, to make a sturdy bench, but also one that's easy to move, <strong>it's gotta break down</strong>. Got it.</p>

    <p>This was accomplished through taking and breaking down the design into sub-assemblies. Rather than having it all be one giant glued-together behemoth, some sort of sturdy and strong fastener would have to make this thing able to come apart but stay built-like-a-tank when it's all together.</p>

    <p>For the sub-assemblies, they (as per my build strategy) would be bomb-proof themselves. As I envisioned it, the top would be one piece, the back cross beams would be separate pieces, and then the side legs would be the big, sturdy tree trunks that would get me going. After some convincing by some friends with good ideas, I decided to take my first foray into <strong>mortise and tenon</strong> joints to incorporate into the legs and increase their strength. More on that to come.</p>

    <h3>Feature - Bench Vise</h3>

    <p>Getting more into woodworking, but taking all the work I do on my bikes as well, I needed a vise. Anything I could use to hold parts and pieces firm while I do some work on them. My inital thought was just to get a standard mechanical vise that I remember my dad having and our shops at work having all over the place. Sturdy, heavy, strong, and versatile.</p>

    <p>After floating my plans and ideas past some buddies, my buddy Zach from college reminded me/told me about a bench vise. Something integrated into the bench, meant more for the woodworking aspects of things I build. I'd never worked with or had one of these, but why the hell not integrate one!? So I found a dealer of woodworking tools here in Germany and snagged a decent looking one that could fit into the little pocket I'd had in mind for it.</p>

    <p class="quickhit">
      <strong>Sidenote:</strong>  One aspect of working on things I'm used to in a new country is finding the stores, dealers, and sources for most of the things I need. First it was bikes, finding places I could order all the parts I needed as I was rebuilding them in the spring. Now, with all these projects, I've been trying to find places to get the tools and materials I need.
    </p>

    <p class="quickhit">
      First one I needed to replace was my Home Depot/Lowe's equivalent. Thanks to my landlords, I got put onto Hornbach, and that place has been pretty reliable for me so far. For my first projects over here (bike stands), that's where I sourced my wood. But for my proceeding projects, I decided I wanted some better quality, so I found Hirsch & Sohn lumberyard. But for projects moving forward, I need to find some hardwoods, as this spruce softwood is good, but easily dented and not for fine projects, depending on the project I guess.
    </p>

    <p class="quickhit">
      Then, for tools, I wanted to for sure stick with DeWalt. That was kind of non-negotiable. In the spring I treated myself to a circular saw, which I found from DeWalt on Amazon. I recently got myself a router, and essentially just did the lowest bidder search from Google. But even still, I gotta keep in mind the need to search for deals when I'm looking for stuff.
    </p>

    <p>My mind set on a bench vise, I figured it wouldn't hurt anything to also get a mechanical vise to go with it. That was an easy find on Amazon.</p>

    <h3>Feature - Backsplash</h3>

    <p>This feature was a late addition (post-completion) to the final build. But, one weird thing about my apartment over here is that I can't drill into the walls. I could, but my landlords HIGHLY suggest not doing that, as the electrical wiring behind the foam whateverthefuck the walls are made out of is not orderly. So I don't want to drill through the material, hit a power cord, and do something bad. That, and as I was staining some pieces on the workbench, I realized I could easily splash a ton of stain on this white wall behind the workbench, and that would not be ideal.</p>

    <p>As luck would have it, from my converting my static desk to a stand-up desk earlier in the year, I still had the desk's back panel laying around. Not having a good project for that in mind, it became cannibalized and added to the back of the work bench to give me something of a back stop in the hopes of keeping the wall behind the bench intact, as well as forcing me to figure out some way to make it functional and cool, like a magnetic phone holder, some kind of tool mounts, or something else. To be determined on that front...</p>

    <h2 id="Materials">Material Selection</h2>

    <p>As I'm still quite the novice, and it matches with my personality, I wanted to get a look and feel at the types and dimensions of lumber that were available to me for this project. So once I'd settled on going to Hirsch & Sohn to get the lumber, I headed down there to see what options I had for boards and sheets.</p>

    <p>Online, the stuff they listed the most were 5m / 15ft long boards. I did NOT need that much, so I'm glad I went in and found that they had smaller usable board types and sizes for sale. And, they came finished and not rough-cut, so that was going to save me a good bunch of time.</p>

    <p>After a good perusing through their stock, I first adjusted to the metric system (that's why I'm including the metric measurements for all you folks back home), and I settled on a few different sizes for the pieces I would need:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>90mm x 90mm - vertical posts, depth struts, back struts</li>
      <li>40mm x 90mm - top braces</li>
      <li>60mm x 80mm - depth struts, back struts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the work-bench top, I wanted to find a balance of good quality wood, and a non-deadly price. From that, found a great balance and it just so happened to come in the depth of my workbench as well. How serendipitous!</p>

    <ul>
      <li>2500mm x 600mm x 27mm - bench top</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After another consultation with my buddy Zack, he provied the wonderful idea of having a sacrificial top on the bench. Sacrificial in the sense that it's liks a placemat. You can make whatever mess and dirt and havoc on that sacrificial top you want, but you still have your nice workbench underneath waiting for you. And, if you slip a drillbit on a piece or something like that, you tear up the sacrificial piece and not the actual work bench. With that, I picked up a passable piece at Hornbach on one of my many trips there.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1350mm x 600mm x 10mm - sacrificial bench top</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Materials set. Now time to design!</p>

    <h2 id="Design">The Design</h2>

    <p>Build requirements and constraints as well as materials in mind and on paper, it was off to OnShape to put it all together and make the ideas come to life. I gotta say, I love using OnShape. It puts me back in the fun classes in College where we got to use Inventor and Solidworks, but this is FREE. Boom.</p>
