    <h2>Background/Motivation</h2>

    <p>My apartment here in Karlsruhe is great. But, it's an apartment, which doesn't come with a garage or a shop or anything like that. Before I moved in, I initially planned on having the extra room as a guest room, but living on my own, 98% of the time it's just me. What's that mean? Turn it into a workshop!</p>

    <p>The one thing I didn't have, that every workshop needs is a good workbench. I'd been using my kitchen table and my desk as one for a good long while, and both of those filled the role quite well. But being capable, willing, and ready to take on another project, I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands and build myself a useful, custom workbench.</p>

    <h2>Project and Design Requirements</h2>

    <h3>Size</h3>

    <p>Space was the biggest limitation and constraint for this build. The room of my workshop is thin and long. Paired with that, I've got my desk taking up a good amount of space, and my bike stands and the bikes hanging on them stick out a good bit taking up a good amount of space. With that, I had two sides of the room I could build it on. After paring it all down, I decided on a width of <em>1350mm</em> and a depth of <em>600mm</em>. Both dimensions allow me to have a good bench size and still maintain some space to move around.</p>

    

    <p>Height was a tough choice. Workbench height is a variable topic, which as I started my googling, has a very variable result. After some digging, essentially it comes down to what kind of work you want to do on the workbench. One of the <a class="body" href="https://extranet.fredhutch.org/en/u/ehs/hamm/chap8/section5.html">references</a> I checked out split it all down by the type of work you're doing on it, Heavy, Light, or Precision. This bench is really gonna be used for a bit of everything. So, after some more hemming and hawing, measuring my dropped-hand length, and all that stuff, I settled on a height of roughly <em>945mm</em>.</p>

    <h3>Form</h3>

    <p>A couple things that kinda relate to the size decision were a couple pieces that I had to incorporate into the piece in order to still make that space viable and usable - my tool chest and my file cabinet. both of those are fairly big and bulky, so somehow being able to incorporate these two big boxes into the workbench were a constraint.</p>

    <p>In order to do that, I wanted to have the bench have an open core, something with a big opening to utilize as a storage space. Due to the height of the tool chest, it had to be from the ground up and not through a shelf or anything. With that in mind, that also led to the Length, Width, and Height designs, but also dictated the dimensions of the materials to be used.</p>

    <h3>Feature - Assembly</h3>

    <p>One thing in the back of my mind is the portability of this unit. First and foremost, the thing's gotta be built like a tank. I'm good at that kinda construction. But it also has to be portable to the point I can get it in and out of a dwelling, as I'm more than likely going to move at some point again in my life and would like to take this with me.</p>

    <p>So, to make a sturdy bench, but also one that's easy to move, it's gotta break down. Got it.</p>

    <p>This was accomplished through taking and breaking down the design
