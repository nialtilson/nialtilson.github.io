    <h1>WOODWORKING</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      Back when I was a kid, I was lucky enough to have a dad that helped me learn how to build, work, and make things with the wonderful material of wood. There's been a good amount of time where this interest and fun hobby has been put on the shelf, but those times where I have the time, tools, and projects to work on, it's something I really enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the interest of sharing some of the many things I tinker with and work on, I wanted to do my best to share those many projects in case anyone else out there has had a similar problem to solve or project to work on, sharing my plans here is something that could hopefully provide some inspiration or ideas to someone else!
