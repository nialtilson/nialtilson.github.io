    <p>
      This section is tied a little bit to the start of my
      <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/2_blogs/2_blogs.html">blogs</a>,
      but in writing up a ton about my life and what I see and do, I
      realized just how visual of a person I am. Ever since then, I've done my
      best to flourish that preference, mostly through the simple act of taking
      a shitton of pictures.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of those that have gone hiking, walked through a city, climbed up a
      mountain, or done something else along those lines with me, have noticed
      I'm usually the one lagging behind the group with my camera pointed at
      something hoping I can turn that view into something representing art.
      Somtimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I'm the one controlling this site though, I get to selectively show
      you only the times where it works! Ownership priveleges, gotta love it!
