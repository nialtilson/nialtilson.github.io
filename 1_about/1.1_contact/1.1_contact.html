    <p>Here's how you can get a hold of me.</p>

    <h3>Email</h3>

    <p>If you thought I was going to give you my actual email address, you're insane. No way. But, if for any reason you'd like to reach out to me directly, don't hesitate to send me a message via <a class="body" href="mailto:wanderingtheworldwithnial@gmail.com">wanderingtheworldwithnial@gmail.com</a>. Whether it's some suggestions about the site, questions or comments about my travels or adventures, or just want to drop me a line for something random, don't hesitate!</p>

    <p>No joke, I love to hear from folks about stuff. Most of the time, I feel like what I put up here just goes into a giant black void. But hearing that people are reading what I write, learning something new, gaining a new interest to travel somewhere, or starting new discussions and wavelengths of thought, that is always REALLY awesome to hear.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Travel and Adventures</h3>

    <p>If you've gone through any of my bigger recent travel posts, you've probably noticed a link at the top to a thing called <a class="body" href="https://www.polarsteps.com/">Polarsteps</a>. Not sure how I learned about this, but it started before/during my trip to New Zealand and has been something I've just kept with ever since. It's an AWESOME way to document a trip while you're underway to keep track of all the fun things you do and see!</p>

    <p>Well, if you're interested, head over to my profile at <a class="body" href="https://www.polarsteps.com/NialTilson">polarsteps.com/NialTilson</a> to see all the adventures I've tracked with this great app!</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Professional</h3>

    <p>A bit redundant, but check over at the <a class="body" href="https://nialtilson.github.io/1_about/1.2_professional/1.2_professional.html">Professional</a> page for more info here. No, I'm not going to give you my work email address either. That'd just be dumb, and probably against company policy.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Social Media</h3>

    <p>Ended up deleting that book of faces a few years ago, and am really glad I did. Unfortunately, rather than being diligent and intelligent about it, I've reallocated that wasted time and energy to other (arguably) useless timewasters. But then again, I'm still human. I think...</p>
