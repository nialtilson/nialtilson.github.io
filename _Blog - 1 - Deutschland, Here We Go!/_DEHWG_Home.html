  <h2>Where do I begin?</h2>

  <div class="body">
    <p>After a few years of applying, I am finally all set and on my way to
    Germany through the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange for Young
    Professionals!  I am incredibly excited to get a chance to experience
    Germany in the next year and get a true taste of this awesome country.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, it was a GREAT vacation.

    Here's a link</a> to the rest of my pictures from the trip.</p>

    <p>But now I'm in Olympia until I go.  I've been doing a lot of yard work
    and construction stuff for friends and family.  I've had the last couple
    of days off, so I've been getting caught up on the clerical stuff and
    making sure I'm on track to leave for DC in ONE MONTH.  Holy crap that's
    coming up fast.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, I've been pretty lax on my German language prep.  The road
    trip really killed it, and I've been keeping busy since I got back.  I know
    it'll help me out, I know it'll give me a good head start for language
    school, but the slacker in me is really coming through pretty strong on
    this front.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, I am getting really pumped to start this program.  I've been
    reading into the Facts about Germany book we got from the German
    Information Center, and getting some more insight into the country I'll
    be living in for a year.  Among that, and keeping up with current events
    here and there, I'm doing my best to prepare some knowledge for
    conversation and such.</p>

  <h2>The Program</h2>

  <div class="body">
    <p>For those that don't know, or that need a refresher, or have no idea
    what this is all about, let me explain.  This past spring, I was invited to
    participate in the <strong>C</strong>ongress-<strong>B</strong>undestag
    <strong>Y</strong>outh e<strong>X</strong>change (CBYX) for Young
    Professionals.  I will be participating in the 30th year of the program,
    and will be traveling to Germany for one year with 74 other young
    professionals from all throughout the U.S.</p>

    <p>The program will last for 12 months.  The first two months will be for
    language school.  The participants are spread out to 3 different cities
    to take intensive language courses for 2 months in order to get a firm
    grasp of the language before moving on in the program.</p>

    <p>Next, we move to a new city and begin the permanent placement phase.
    This will consist of 4 months of University classes, and then a 5 month
    internship.  While we are taking classes, we will be in charge of securing
    an internship for the program.  This means we could be doing anything,
    and depends on what we are able to find.  After the internship phase is
    complete, we will have a couple of weeks to travel before we return to
    the U.S.  The purpose of this program is to give participants exposure
    to the culture of Germany, and to build relationships with the people that
    we meet.</p>

    <p>While we are there, we could be living with a host family, a dorm, or a
    shared apartment, and really depends on where we are placed.  The program
    is run by two organizations.  In the U.S., all the planning is done by
    Cultural Vistas, but in Germany, all of the planning is done by the
    Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (G.I.Z.).  They
    are in charge of our placements and logistics during the program.</p>

    <p>I recently found out that I will be taking language school in KÃ¶ln,
    Germany (Cologne), and my permanent placement will be somewhere in the
    Bundesland (State) of Sachsen-Anhalt.  It's a great treat to get some more
    details regarding the trip.  And from what I've heard, both places have
    tons to offer and see.  I get more and more excited for this adventure by
    the day!!!</p>
